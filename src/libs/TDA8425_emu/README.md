# TDA8425

This library aims to emulate the
[*Philips Semiconductors TDA8425* Hi-fi stereo audio processor](doc/TDA8425.pdf).

![Block diagram](doc/block_diagram.png)

The original goal is to contribute to the emulation of the *AdLib Gold* sound
card, which used such integrated circuit to add sound effects to the audio
output, as heard in the beautiful soundtrack of the *Dune* videogame, made
specifically for that rare sound card.

As I do not know how the actual circuits are made, I cannot emulate the chip
perfectly. Instead, my goal is to simulate the overall sound, based on the
short information available.

If anybody can analyze a decapped chip, that would of course be the best
information, as already done for many vintage sound chips.

I am willing to get some real chips, as long as they are available for
purchase, at least for black-box comparisons with dedicated test vectors.

## Usage

To use this library, just include `TDA8425_emu.c` and `TDA8425_emu.h`
into your project.

The engine implements the following conceptual flow:

1. `TDA8425_Chip` memory allocation.
2. Call `TDA8425_Chip_Ctor()` to invalidate internal data.
3. Call `TDA8425_Chip_Setup()` to initialize static settings.
4. Call `TDA8425_Chip_Reset()` to clear emulated registers.
5. Call `TDA8425_Chip_Write()` for each register to inizialize.
6. Call `TDA8425_Chip_Start()` to start the algorithms.
7. Processing loop:
    1. Call `TDA8425_Chip_Process()` for each sample, with appropriate data
       types.
8. Call `TDA8425_Chip_Stop()` to stop the algorithms.
9. Call `TDA8425_Chip_Dtor()` to deallocate and invalidate internal data.
10. `TDA8425_Chip` memory deallocation.

Register access timings are not emulated.

You can give a look at the [TDA8425_pipe example](example/TDA8425_pipe.c) for
more details.

## Implementation details

Here you can find some descriptions and discussions about implementation
details.

### Language

I chose *C99*, because I find good old and mature C to be the best for such a
tiny library. C is also easier to integrate with other languages.

### Cross-platform support

The code itself should be cross-platform and clean enough not to give
compilation errors or ambiguity.

Currently the library is developed and tested under *Windows* with *MSVC++14*.
Of course, I will at least provide support for *gcc* and *clang* under *Linux*.
I do not have access to *macOS*, but I guess the *Linux* support should fit.

### Code style

I chose the path of verbosity for variable declaration, to help debugging fixed
point math and buffering. Indeed, when compiled for performance, all those
variable declarations get optimized away easily.

### Floating-point

It is possible to configure the floating point data type used for processing,
via the `TDA8425_FLOAT` preprocessor symbol. It defaults to `double`
(*double precision*).

Please note that, contrary to common beliefs, the `double` data type is
actually very fast on machines with hardware support for it.

I think that you should switch to `float` (*single precision*) only if:

- the hardware is limited to it, or
- if machine code vectorization gets faster, or
- conversion from/to buffer data to/from double precision is slower.

### Input selector

The input selector simply chooses which channels to feed to the internal
processing units.

The `TDA8425_Chip_Process()` method is always provided with two stereo sources.

### DC removal

The library can optionally apply a high-pass filter at 10 Hz to the inputs, in
order to emulate the DC removal shown in the frequency response charts.

It is activated by the `TDA8425_USE_DC_REMOVAL` preprocessor symbol.

### Filter model cache

Although rare, it might be possible to continuously change bass and treble
gains. This would recompute filter coefficients each time.

In order to speed up processing, the `TDA8425_USE_MODEL_CACHE` preprocessor
symbol lets precompute all the possible models at the specified sample rate,
within `TDA8425_Chip_Setup()`.
This way, changing gains means to simply switch to another precomputed model.

This option is disabled by default.

## Stereo modes

### Forced mono

The *forced mono* mode simply adds the two input channels together, duplicating
the summed signal.

It looks like there is an error in the datasheet, where a switch on the right
channel is flipped, leading to some weird path, while it is clear that it would
simply feed the opamp with the sum of the two channels, just like for the left
channel:

![Forced mono errata corrige](doc/mono_errata.png)

### Linear stereo

The *linear stereo* mode does not alter the two input channels.

### Pseudo stereo

The *pseudo stereo* mode applies two cascaded all-pass filters to the left
channel.

All-pass filters can be configured by changing the external capacitance, as per
an actual chip. The library provides the three preset values mentioned in the
datasheet.

The datasheet describes the pseudo stereo with a clear schematic.
By knowning the phase diagram and the associated capacitance values, it is
possible to calculate the internal resistance values.
The script [TDA8425_pseudo.py](tools/TDA8425_pseudo.py) was used in the
development, to expand the expressions to calculate the biquad coefficients.
It also helped in the identification of internal resistance values, which
should be around 15 kÎ©, but it looks like the plots on the datasheet are not as
accurate as those of the script.

The filter as a whole is implemented as a *biquad* filter.

![Pseudo stereo phase diagram](doc/pseudo_phase.png)

### Spatial stereo

The *spatial stereo* simply adds some cross-talk between the channels.

The relationship between generic channels *a* and *b* is the following:

    Voa(t) = Via(t) + Rfa/Rc * (Via(t) - Vib(t))

where `Rfa/Rc` is 52%.

A simple ideal circuit is emulated in the *SPICE* model:
[TDA8425_spatial.asc](tools/TDA8425_spatial.asc).

## Tone control

The datasheet plots the frequency response diagrams of two filters: the
*specified* one, and the mysterious (at least for me) *T-filter*.

The *specified* filter is a classic Baxandall-like tone control, with single
pole/zero shelving filters for both bass and treble controls.
It looks like the they are centered around 300 Hz and 4500 Hz, respectively.
I chose *bi-linear* implementation instead of *bi-quadratic* for both filters,
to maintain separation of concerns.
They were designed with the help of the
[TDA8425_shelving.py](tools/TDA8425_shelving.py) Python script.


Furthermore, it looks like the *T-filter* has an additional second-order
frequency response for bass control, which is factored into a dedicated biquad
filter. You can refer to the
[TDA8425_tfilter.py](tools/TDA8425_tfilter.py) Python script for reference.
The *T-filter* is activated by the `TDA8425_USE_TFILTER` preprocessor symbol.

## TDA8425_pipe example

This repository provides a fully-featured example. It is a stream processor, in
that it processes sample data coming from *standard input*, elaborates it, and
generates outputs on the *standard output*.

Please refer to its own help page, by calling the canonical
`TDA8425_pipe --help`, or reading it embedded in
[its source code](example/TDA8425_pipe.c).

### Usage example with Lubuntu 20.04

1. Ensure the following packages are installed:

```bash
sudo apt install alsa-utils audacity build-essential python3
```

2. Enter [example](example) folder and run [make_gcc.sh](example/make_gcc.sh):

```bash
cd example
bash make_gcc.sh
```

3. You should find the generated executable file as `TDA8425_pipe`.

4. Generate some noise at 192000 Hz, stereo, signed 16-bit little-endian:

```bash
python3 gen_noise.py
```

5. You should find the generated noise sample as `noise.raw`.

6. Process noise to have full bass and treble boost, with *T-filter*:

```bash
./TDA8425_pipe -r 192000 -c 2 -f S16_LE -v -6 -b +15 -t +12 --t-filter < noise.raw > out.raw
```

7. Import `out.raw` as *raw data* with *Audacity*:

![Import raw data](doc/import_raw_data.png)

8. Plot the spectrum analysis:

![Full boost spectrum analysis](doc/full_boost.png)

9. You can also play the audio directly with `aplay` (the `\` is for command
   line continuation):

```bash
./TDA8425_pipe -r 192000 -c 2 -f S16_LE -v -6 -b +15 -t +12 --t-filter < noise.raw \
| aplay -c 2 -r 192000 -f S16_LE
```
