 * DOSBox MP3 Seek Table handler, Copyright 2018 Kevin R. Croft (krcroft@gmail.com)
 *
 * Problem:
 *          Seeking within an MP3 file to an exact time-offset, such as is expected
 *          within DOS games, is extremely difficult because the MP3 format doesn't
 *          provide a defined relationship between the compressed data stream positions
 *          versus decompressed PCM times.
 *
 * Solution:
 *          To solve this, we step through each compressed MP3 frames in
 *          the MP3 file (without decoding the actual audio) and keep a record of the
 *          decompressed "PCM" times for each frame.  We save this relationship to
 *          to a local fie, called a fast-seek look-up table, which we can quickly
 *          reuse every subsequent time we need to seek within the MP3 file.  This allows
 *          seeks to be performed extremely fast while being PCM-exact.
 *
 *          This "fast-seek" file can hold data for multiple MP3s to avoid
 *          creating an excessive number of files in the local working directory.
 *
 * Challenges:
 *       1. What happens if an MP3 file is changed but the MP3's filename remains the same?
 *
 *          The lookup table is indexed based on a checksum instead of filename.
 *          The checksum is calculated based on a subset of the MP3's content in
 *          addition to being seeded based on the MP3's size in bytes.
 *          This makes it very sensitive to changes in MP3 content; if a change
 *          is detected a new lookup table is generated.
 *
 *       2. Checksums can be weak, what if a collision happens?
 *
 *          To avoid the risk of collision, we use the current best-of-breed
 *          xxHash algorithm that has a quality-score of 10, the highest rating
 *          from the SMHasher test set.  See https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash
 *          for more details.
 *
 *       3. What happens if fast-seek file is brought from a little-endian
 *          machine to a big-endian machine (x86 or ARM to a PowerPC or Sun
 *          Sparc machine)?
 *
 *          The lookup table is serialized and multi-byte types are byte-swapped
 *          at runtime according to the architecture. This makes fast-seek files
 *          cross-compatible regardless of where they were written to or read from.
 *
 *       4. What happens if this code is updated to use a new fast-seek file
 *          format, but an old fast-seek file exists?
 *
 *          The seek-table file is versioned (see SEEK_TABLE_IDENTIFIER befow),
 *          therefore, if the format and version is updated, then the seek-table
 *          will be regenerated.
