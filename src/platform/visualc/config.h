//  - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes

// MSVC issues warnings on what it considers "unsafe" C-calls for

//
// To date, no effort has been made to transition toward these _s
// calls, in part because no static analyzer (Coverity, PVS Studio,
// or Clang) has flagged the project's use of the existing non-_s
// calls as having security implications.
//
// Likewise, if there is going to be work put into altering the use
// of these calls, it will involve transitioning toward modern C++
// constructs as mentioned in #1314 (Ref:
// https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/issues/1314)
//
// Because the recommendations in these warnings will not be acted
// upon given the planned direction of the the project, they
// therefore provide no value and are being silenced.
