# Per the auto-tools clean guidelines:
# https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/automake/manual/html_node/Clean.html#Clean
#
# "if configure built it, then 'distclean' should delete it", however the generated
# _distclean_ target misses many files generated by ./configure, so we augment them
# here.  We also add those files generated by automake and autoconf to ensure 'distclean'
# reverts the directory back to its original as-distributed source tree.
#
# (note: with recursive makefiles, these files could be defined as individual distclean-local:
# targets inside each sub-directory's Makefile.am, however listing them in one target here
# is easier manage as they can all be seen at once.)
