# DOSBox Staging

![GPL-2.0-or-later][gpl-badge]
[![Chat][discord-badge]][discord]

DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox with advanced features and current development practices.

It is a (mostly) drop-in replacement for older DOSBox versions—your existing configurations will continue to work, and you will have access to many advanced features.

For a detailed description of the project's scope please refer to the [About](https://www.dosbox-staging.org/about/) page on our website.

## Get the sources

Clone the repository (one-time step):

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging.git
```

## Build instructions

Read [docs/BUILD.md] for the comprehensive compilation guide.

> **Note**
>
> CMake support is currently an experimental internal-only, work-in-progress
> feature; it's not ready for public consumption yet. Please ignore the
> `CMakeLists.txt` files in the source tree.


### Linux, macOS

Install build dependencies appropriate for your OS:

``` shell
# Fedora
sudo dnf install ccache gcc-c++ meson alsa-lib-devel libatomic libpng-devel \
                 SDL2-devel SDL2_net-devel opusfile-devel \
                 fluidsynth-devel iir1-devel mt32emu-devel libslirp-devel \
                 speexdsp-devel libXi-devel zlib-ng-devel
```

``` shell
# Debian, Ubuntu
sudo apt install ccache build-essential libasound2-dev libatomic1 libpng-dev \
                 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libopusfile-dev \
                 libfluidsynth-dev libslirp-dev libspeexdsp-dev libxi-dev

# Install Meson on Debian-11 "Bullseye" or Ubuntu-21.04 and newer
sudo apt install meson
```

``` shell
# Arch, Manjaro
sudo pacman -S ccache gcc meson alsa-lib libpng sdl2 sdl2_net \
               opusfile fluidsynth libslirp speexdsp libxi pkgconf
```

``` shell
# openSUSE
sudo zypper install ccache gcc gcc-c++ meson alsa-devel libatomic1 libpng-devel \
                    libSDL2-devel libSDL2_net-devel \
                    opusfile-devel fluidsynth-devel libmt32emu-devel libslirp-devel \
                    speexdsp libXi-devel
```

``` shell
# macOS
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ccache meson libpng sdl2 sdl2_net opusfile \
     fluid-synth libslirp pkg-config python3 speexdsp
```

### Build and stay up-to-date with the latest sources

1. Check out the main branch:

    ``` shell
    # commit or stash any personal code changes
    git checkout main -f
    ```

2. Pull the latest updates. This is necessary every time you want a new build:

    ``` shell
    git pull
    ```

3. Set up the build. This is a one-time step either after cloning the repo or
    cleaning your working directories:

    ``` shell
    meson setup build
    ```

    The above enables all of DOSBox Staging's functional features. If you're
    interested in seeing all of Meson's setup options, run `meson configure`.

4. Compile the sources. This is necessary every time you want a new build:

    ``` shell
    meson compile -C build
    ```

    Your binary is: `build/dosbox`

    The binary depends on local resources relative to it, so we suggest
    symlinking to the binary from your `PATH`, such as into `~/.local/bin/`.


### Windows – Visual Studio (2022 or newer)

First, you need to setup [vcpkg] to install build dependencies. Once vcpkg
is bootstrapped, open PowerShell and run:

``` powershell
PS:\> .\vcpkg integrate install
```

This step will ensure that MSVC can use vcpkg to build, find and links all
dependencies.

Start Visual Studio and open the file `vs\dosbox.sln`. Make sure you have
`x64` selected as the solution platform.  Use **Ctrl+Shift+B** to build all
projects.

Note, the first time you build a configuration, dependencies will be built
automatically and stored in the `vcpkg_installed` directory. This can take
a significant length of time.

### Windows (MSYS2), macOS (MacPorts), Haiku, NixOS, others

Instructions for other build systems and operating systems are documented
in [docs/BUILD.md].

## Imported branches, community patches, old forks

Upstream commits are imported to this repo in a timely manner,
see branch [`svn/trunk`].

- [`svn/*`] - branches from SVN
- [`forks/*`] - code for various abandoned DOSBox forks
- [`vogons/*`] - community patches posted on the Vogons forum

Git tags matching pattern `svn/*` are pointing to the commits referenced by SVN
"tag" paths at the time of creation.

Additionally, we attach some optional metadata to the commits in the form of
[Git notes][git-notes]. To fetch them, run:

``` shell
git fetch origin "refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*"
```
