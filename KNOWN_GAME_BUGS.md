This file captures the known bugs that already exist in the games that are not introduced by this emulator.



# Return to Zork

* This game has no subtitles. (https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=86635)
* The lack of the flashing effect when taking a photo is accurate. The game behaves this way on hardware, as well. (https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=1052487#p1052487)
* The awful borders around the crank and box overlays in the hardware store are also accurate. (https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=1052487#p1052487)
* When the Guardian disappears, the background appears far before the overlays fade in. This is also accurate. (https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=1052487#p1052487)


# Lord of the Rings


* Hitting space+esc locks things up real good.
* Loading the demo on the title screen gives a "FMPOpen Error Code: 0" error message (https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=1049075#p1049075)



# Man Enough

* No subtitles in first scene (see: https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=1048737#p1048737)
