DOSBox v0.62


=====
NOTE: 
=====

While we hope that, one day, DOSBox will run virtually all programs
ever made for the PC...we are not there yet. At present, DOSBox run on a high-
end machine will roughly be the equivalent of a 486 PC. The 0.60
release has added support for "protected mode" allowing for more complex and
recent programs, but note that this support is early in development and
nowhere near as complete as the support for 386 real-mode games (or
earlier). Also note that "protected mode" games need substantially more
resources and may require a much faster processor for you to run it properly
in DOSBox.

Some Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: I've got a Z instead of a C at the prompt.
Q: My CD-ROM doesn't work.
Q: The mouse doesn't work.
Q: The sound stutters.
Q: I can't type \ or : in DOSBox.
Q: The game/application can't find its CD-ROM.
Q: The game/application runs much too slow!
Q: I would like to change the memory size/cpu speed/ems/soundblaster IRQ.
Q: What sound hardware does DOSBox presently emulate?






Q: I've got a Z instead of a C at the prompt.
A: You have to make your directories available as drives in DOSBox by using
   the "mount" command. For example, in Windows "mount C D:\" would give
   you a C in DOSBox which points at your Windows D:\ drive.
   In Linux, "mount c /home/username" would give you a C in DOSBox
   which points at /home/username in Linux.

Q: My CD-ROM doesn't work.
A: To mount your cdrom in DOSBox you have to specify some additional options 
   when mounting the cdrom. 
   To enable the most basic cdrom support:
     - mount d f:\ -t cdrom
   To enable low-level SDL-support:
     - mount d f:\ -t cdrom -usecd 0
   To enable low-level ioctl-support(win2k/xp/linux):
     - mount d f:\ -t cdrom -usecd 0 -ioctl
   To enable low-level aspi-support (win98 with aspi-layer installed):
     - mount d f:\ -t cdrom -usecd 0 -apsi
   
   In the commands: - d    driveletter you in DOSBox
                    - f:\ location of cdrom on your PC.
                    - 0   The number of the cdrom drive, reported by mount -cd
   See also the question: The game/application can't find its CD-ROM.


Q: The mouse doesn't work.
A: Normally DOSBox detects the mouse being used by a game. If you click on 
   the screen then it should get locked and work.
   Sometimes the DOSBox mouse detection doesn't work with certain games. You
   might have to force to lock the mouse then with ctrl-F10.


Q: The sound stutters.
A: You're using too much cpu power to keep DOSBox running at the current speed.
   You can either lower the cycles or skip frames or get a faster machine.
   You can also increase the prebuffer in the configfile

Q: I can't type \ or : in DOSBox.
A: This is a known problem. It only occurs if your keyboard layout isn't US.
   Some possible fixes:
     1. Switch your keyboard layout.
     2. Use / instead.
     3. Add the commands you want to execute to dosbox.conf
     4. Start the keymapper (CTRL-F1 or add -startmapper switch to dosbox)
     5. for \ try the keys around enter. For : try shift and the keys between
        enter and "l" (US keyboard layout).

Q: The game/application can't find its CD-ROM.
A: Be sure to mount the CD-ROM with -t cdrom switch. Also try adding the
   correct label (-label LABEL). To enable more low-level CD-ROM support add
   the following switch to mount: -usecd #, where # is the number of your 
   CD-ROM drive reported by mount -cd. If you run Win32 you can specify -ioctl
   or -aspi. Look at the description elsewhere in this document for their 
   meaning.


Q: The game/application runs much too slow!
A: Look at the section "To run resource-demanding games" for more information.


Q: I would like to change the memory size/cpu speed/ems/soundblaster IRQ.
A: This is possible! Just create a config file: config -writeconf dosbox.conf .
   Start your favourite editor and look at all the settings present. To
   start DOSBox with your new settings: dosbox -conf dosbox.conf


Q: What sound hardware does DOSBox presently emulate?
A: DOSBox emulates several legacy sound devices:
   - Internal PC speaker
     This emulation includes both the tone generator and several forms of
     digital sound output through the internal speaker.
   - Creative CMS/Gameblaster
     The is the first card released by Creative Labs(R).  The default 
     configuration places it on port 0x220.  It should be noted that enabling 
     this with the Adlib emulation may result in conflicts.
   - Tandy 3 voice
     The emulation of this sound hardware is complete with the exception of 
     the noise channel, which is not very well documented and as such is only 
     a best guess as to the sound's accuracy.
   - Adlib
     Borrowed from MAME, this emulation is almost perfect and includes the 
     Adlib's ability to almost play digitized sound.
   - SoundBlaster Pro
     Coupled with the Adlib, DOSBox provides Soundblaster Pro level 8-bit 
     stereo sound.
   - Disney Soundsource
     Using the printer port, this sound device outputs digital sound only.
   - Gravis Ultrasound
     The emulation of this hardware is nearly complete, though the MIDI 
     capabilities have been left out since an MPU-401 has been 
     emulated in other code.
   - MPU-401
     A MIDI passthrough interface is also emulated.  This method of sound 
     output will only work when used with a General Midi or MT-32 device.


Q: Great README, but I still don't get it.
A: While unlikely, this seems to happen. A look at "The Newbie's 
   pictorial guide to DOSBox" located at 
   http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewforum.php?f=39 might help you.

3. Usage:
=========

An overview of the commandline options you can give to DOSBox:

dosbox [name] [-exit] [-c command] [-fullscreen] [-conf congfigfile] 
       [-lang languagefile] [-machine machinetype] [-noconsole]
       [-startmapper]
       
dosbox -version

  name   
        If "name" is a directory it'll mount that as the C: drive.
        If "name" is an executable it'll mount the directory of "name" 
        as the C: drive and execute "name".
    
  -exit  
        dosbox will exit after the "name" has been executed.

  -c command
        Runs the specified command before running "name". Multiple commands
        can be specified. Each command should start with -c though.

  -fullscreen
        Starts dosbox in fullscreen mode.

  -conf configfile
        Start dosbox with the options specified in "configfile".

  -lang languagefile
        Start dosbox using the language string specified in "languagefile".

  -noconsole (Windows Only)
        Start dosbox without showing the console window. Output will
	be redirected to stdout.txt and stderr.txt
	
  -machine machinetype
        Setup dosbox to emulate a specific type of machine. Valid choices are:
        hercules, cga, tandy, vga (default).

  -startmapper
        Enter the keymapper directly on startup. Useful for people with 
        keyboard problems.

  -version
        output version information and exit. Useful for frontends.

Note: If a name/command/configfile/languagefile contains a space in it, put
      the whole name/command/configfile/languagefile between quotes("example").

For example:

dosbox c:\atlantis\atlantis.exe -c "MOUNT D C:\SAVES"
  This would mount c:\atlantis as c:\ and run atlantis.exe.
  Before it does that it would first mount C:\SAVES as the D drive.

In Windows you can also drag directories/files onto the dosbox executable.
 


=====================
4. Internal Programs:
=====================

DOSBox supports most of the DOS commands found in command.com. 
In addition, the following commands are available: 

MOUNT "Emulated Drive letter" "Real Drive or Directory" 
      [-t type] [-aspi] [-ioctl] [-usecd number] [-size drivesize] 
      [-label drivelabel] [-freesize sizemb]
MOUNT -cd
    
  Program to mount local directories as drives inside DOSBox.

  "Emulated Drive letter"
        The driveletter inside dosbox (eg. C).

  "Real Drive letter or Directory"
        The local directory you want to have inside dosbox.
        (Under Win32 usually the same as "Emulated Drive letter".
	For Example: mount c c:\ )

  -t type
        Type of the mounted directory. Supported are: dir (standard),
        floppy, cdrom.

  -size drivesize
        Sets the size of the drive.

  -freesize sizemb
        Sets the amount of free space available on a drive in MB's. This
        is a more simple version of -size.	

  -label drivelabel
        Sets the name of the drive to "drivelabel". Needed on some 
        systems if the cd label isn't read correctly. Useful when a 
        program can't find its cdrom.

  -aspi
        Forces to use the aspi layer. Only valid if mounting a cdrom under 
        Windows systems with an ASPI-Layer.

  -ioctl   
        Forces to use ioctl commands. Only valid if mounting a cdrom under 
        a Windows OS which support them (Win2000/XP/NT).

  -usecd number
        Forces to use SDL cdrom support for drive number.
        Number can be found by -cd. Valid on all systems.

  -cd
        Displays all detected cdrom drives and their numbers. Use with -usecd.

  Note: It's possible to mount a local directory as cdrom drive. 
        Hardware support is then missing.

  Basically, MOUNT allows you to connect real hardware to DOSBox's "emulated"
  PC. So MOUNT C C:\ tells DOSBox to use your real C: drive as drive C: in
  DOSBox. It also allows you to change the drive's letter identification for
  programs that demand specific drive letters.
  
  For example: Touche: Adventures of The Fifth Musketeer must be run on your C:
  drive. Using DOSBox and its mount command, you can trick into thinking it
  is on C drive while placing it where you want it. For example, if the game
  were in D:\TOUCHE, you can use the command MOUNT C D:\ would allow you to
  run Touche from the D drive.
    

  General MOUNT Examples:
  1. To mount c:\floppy as a floppy : 
       mount a c:\floppy -t floppy
  2. To mount system cdrom drive E as cdrom drive D in DOSBox:
       mount d e:\ -t cdrom
  3. To mount system cdrom drive at mountpoint /media/cdrom as cdrom drive D 
     in dosbox:
       mount d /media/cdrom -t cdrom -usecd 0
  4. To mount a drive with 870 mb free diskspace (simple version):
       mount c d:\ -freesize 870
  5. To mount a drive with 870 mb free diskspace (experts only, full control):
       mount c d:\ -size 4025,127,16513,1700
  6. To mount /home/dos/dosgames as drive C in DOSBox:
       mount c /home/dos/dosgames

MEM
  Program to display the amount of free memory.

CONFIG [-writeconf] [-writelang] localfile
  Write the current configuration or language settings to file.
  "localfile" is located on the local drive !!! 

  Example:
  To create a configfile in your current directory:
    config -writeconf dosbox.conf
    
    
LOADFIX [-size] [program] [program-parameters]
LOADFIX -f
  Program to "eat up" memory. Useful for old programs which don't expect much
  memory to be free.

  -size	        
        number of kb to "eat up", default = 64kb
  
  -f
        frees all previously allocated memory
  

Examples:
  1. To start mm2.exe and allocate 64kb memory :
     loadfix mm2
  2. To start mm2.exe and allocate 32kb memory :
     loadfix -32 mm2
  3. To free previous allocated memory :
     loadfix -f


RESCAN
  Make DOSBox reread the directory structure. Useful if you changed something
  on a mounted drive outside of DOSBox.
  

MIXER
  Makes DOSBox display its current volume settings. 
  You can change this way:
  
  mixer channel left:right [/NOSHOW]
  
  channel
      Can be one of the following: MASTER, DISNEY, SPKR, GUS, SB, FM.
  
  left:right
      The volume levels in percentages. If you put a D in front it will be
      in deciBell (example mixer gus d-10).
  
  /NOSHOW
      Prevents DOSBox from showing the result if you set one
      of the volume levels.
  
  
IMGMOUNT
  A utility to mount disk images and CD-ROM images in DOSBox.
  
  IMGMOUNT DRIVE [imagefile] -t [image_type] -fs [image_format] 
            -size [sectorsbytesize, sectorsperhead, heads, cylinders]

  imagefile
      location of the image files to mount in DOSBox.  Path is relative to 
      a mount point already inside DOSBox. CD-ROM images can be mounted
      directly as well (path on the host).
   
  -t 
      The following are valid image types:
        floppy: Specifies a floppy image or images.  DOSBox will automatically 
                identify the disk geometry ( 360K, 1.2MB, 720K, 1.44MB, etc).
        iso:    Specifies a CD-ROM iso image.  The geometry is automatic and 
                set for this size. This can be an iso or a cue/bin.
        hdd:    Specifies a harddrive image. The proper CHS geometry 
                must be set for this to work.

  -fs 
      The following are valid file system formats:
        iso:  Specifies the ISO 9660 CD-ROM format.
        fat:  Specifies the image uses the FAT file system. DOSBox will attempt
              to mount this image as a drive in DOSBox and make the files 
              available from inside DOSBox.
        none: DOSBox will make no attempt to read the file system on the disk.
              This is useful if one needs to format it or one wants to boot 
              off of the disk using the BOOT command.  When using the "none" 
              filesystem, one must specify the drive number (2 or 3, 
              where 2 = master, 3 = slave) rather than a drive letter.  
              For example, to mount a 70MB image as the slave drive device, 
              one would type:
                "imgmount 3 d:\test.img -size 512,63,16,142 -fs none" 
                (without the quotes)  Compare this with a mount to read the 
                drive in DOSBox, which would read as: 
                "imgmount e: d:\test.img -size 512,63,16,142"

  -size 
     The Cylinders, Heads and Sectors specification of the drive.
     Required to mount hard drive images.
     
  An example of CD-ROM images:
    1a. mount c /tmp
    1b. imgmount d c:\myiso.iso -t iso
  or (which also works):
    2. imgmount d /tmp/myiso.iso -t iso


BOOT
  Boot will start floppy images or hard disk images independent of the 
  operating system emulation offered by DOSBox.  This will allow you to play 
  booter floppies or boot to other operating systems inside DOSBox.

  BOOT [diskimg1.img diskimg2.img .. diskimgN.img] [-l driveletter]

  diskimgN.img 
     This can be any number of floppy disk images one wants mounted after 
     DOSBox boots the specified drive letter.
     To swap between images, one hits CTRL+F4 to swap out the current disk 
     and swap in the next disk in the list. Once the last disk in the list is 
     swapped out, the list loops back to the beginning.

  [-l driveletter]
     This parameter allows one to specify the drive to boot from.  
     The default is the A drive, the floppy drive.  One can also boot off of 
     a hard drive image mounted as master by specifying "-l C" 
     without the quotes, or the drive as slave by specifying "-l D"


IPX

  You need to enable IPX networking in the configuration file of DOSBox.

  All of the IPX networking is managed through the internal DOSBox program 
  IPXNET. For help on the IPX networking from inside DOSBox, type 
  "IPXNET HELP" (without quotes) and the program will list out the commands 
  and relevant documentation. 

  With regard to actually setting up a network, one system needs to be 
  the server. To set this up, in a DOSBox session, one should type 
  "IPXNET STARTSERVER" (without the quotes). The server DOSBox session will 
  automatically add itself to the virtual IPX network. In turn, for every 
  other computer that should be part of the virtual IPX network, 
  you'll need to type "IPXNET CONNECT <computer host name or IP>". 
  For example, if your server is at bob.dosbox.com, 
  you would type "IPXNET CONNECT bob.dosbox.com" on every non-server system. 
  
  The following is an IPXNET command reference: 

  IPXNET CONNECT 

     IPXNET CONNECT opens a connection to an IPX tunneling server 
     running on another DOSBox session. The "address" parameter specifies 
     the IP address or host name of the server computer. One can also 
     specify the UDP port to use. By default IPXNET uses port 213, the 
     assigned IANA port for IPX tunneling, for its connection. 

     The syntax for IPXNET CONNECT is: 
     IPXNET CONNECT address <port> 

  IPXNET DISCONNECT 

     IPXNET DISCONNECT closes the connection to the IPX tunneling server. 

     The syntax for IPXNET DISCONNECT is: 
     IPXNET DISCONNECT 

  IPXNET STARTSERVER 

     IPXNET STARTSERVER starts and IPX tunneling server on this DOSBox 
     session. By default, the server will accept connections on UDP port 
     213, though this can be changed. Once the server is started, DOSBox 
     will automatically start a client connection to the IPX tunneling server. 

     The syntax for IPXNET STARTSERVER is: 
     IPXNET STARTSERVER <port> 

  IPXNET STOPSERVER 

     IPXNET STOPSERVER stops the IPX tunneling server running on this DOSBox
     session. Care should be taken to ensure that all other connections have 
     terminated as well since stopping the server may cause lockups on other 
     machines still using the IPX tunneling server. 

     The syntax for IPXNET STOPSERVER is: 
     IPXNET STOPSERVER 

  IPXNET PING 

     IPXNET PING broadcasts a ping request through the IPX tunneled network. 
     In response, all other connected computers will respond to the ping 
     and report the time it took to receive and send the ping message. 

     The syntax for IPXNET PING is: 
     IPXNET PING 

  IPXNET STATUS 

     IPXNET STATUS reports the current state of this DOSBox's sessions 
     IPX tunneling network. For a list of the computers connected to the 
     network use the IPXNET PING command. 

The syntax for IPXNET STATUS is: 
IPXNET STATUS 

For more information use the /? command line switch with the programs.




================
5. Special Keys:
================

ALT-ENTER       Go full screen and back.
CTRL-F1         Start the keymapper.
CTRL-F4         Swap mounted disk-image (Only used with imgmount).
CTRL-F5         Save a screenshot.
CTRL-F6         Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
CTRL-ALT-F7     Start/Stop recording of OPL commands.
CTRL-ALT-F8     Start/Stop the recording of raw MIDI commands.
CTRL-F7         Decrease frameskip.
CTRL-F8         Increase frameskip.
CTRL-F9         Kill dosbox.
CTRL-F10        Capture/Release the mouse.
CTRL-F11        Slow down emulation (Decrease DOSBox Cycles).
CTRL-F12        Speed up emulation (Increase DOSox Cycles).

These are the default keybindings. They can be changed in the keymapper.

NOTE: Once you increase your DOSBox cycles beyond your computer's maximum
capacity, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the emulation.
This maximum will vary from computer to computer, there is no standard.



=============
6. Keymapper:
=============

When you start the keymapper (either with CTRL-F1 or -startmapper as a
commandline argument) you are presented with a virtual keyboard.

This virtual keyboard corresponds with the keys DOSBox will report to its
applications. If you click on a key with your mouse, you can see in the
lowerleft corner which key on your keyboard corresponds with it.

Event: EVENT
BIND: BIND
                        Add   Del
mod1  hold                    Next
mod2
mod3


EVENT
    The key DOSBox will report to the applications being emulated.
BIND
    The key on your keyboard (as reported by SDL) which is connected to the
    EVENT.
mod1,2,3 
    Modfiers. These are keys you need to have pressed as well, while pressing 
    BIND. mod1 = CTRL and mod2 = ALT. These are generally only used when you 
    want to change the special keys of DOSBox.
Add 
    Add a new BIND to this EVENT. Basicly add a key from your keyboard which
    will produce the key EVENT in DOSBox.
Del 
    Delete the BIND to this EVENT. If an EVENT has no BINDS than it's not
    possible to type this key in DOSBox.
Next
    Cycle through the list of keys(BINDS) which map to this EVENT.


Example:
Q1. You want to have the X on your keyboard to type a Z in DOSBox.
    A. With your mouse click on the Z on the keyboard mapper. Click "Add". 
       Now press the X key on your keyboard. 

Q2. If you click "Next" a few times you will notice that the Z on your 
    keyboard also produces an Z in DOSBox.
    A. Therefore select the Z again and click "Next" till you have the Z on 
       your keyboard. Now click "Del".

Q3. If you try it out in DOSBox you will notice that pressing X makes ZX
    appear.
     A. The X on your keyboard is still mapped to the X as well! Click on
        the X in the keyboard mapper and search with "Next" till you find the 
        mapped key X. Click "Del".


If you change the default mapping you can save your changes by pressing
"Save". DOSBox will save the mapping to location specified in the configfile
(mapperfile=mapper.txt). At startup DOSBox will load your mapperfile if it's
present in the configfile.



=======================
7. System requirements:
=======================

Fast machine. My guess would be pentium-2 400+ to get decent emulation
of games written for an 286 machine.
For protected mode games a 1 Ghz machine is recommended and don't expect
them to run fast though!! Be sure to read the next section on how to speed
it up somewhat.



===================================
8. To run resource-demanding games: 
===================================

DOSBox emulates the CPU, the sound and graphic cards, and some other
stuff, all at the same time. You can overclock DOSBox by using CTRL+F12, but
you'll be limited by the power of your actual CPU. You can see how much free
time your true CPU has by looking at the Task Manager in Windows 2000/XP and
the System Monitor in Windows 95/98/ME. Once 100% of your real CPU time is
used there is no further way to speed up DOSBox unless you reduce the load
generated by the non-CPU parts of DOSBox. 

So: 

Close every program but DOSBox 

Overclock DOSBox until 100% of your CPU is used (use the utilities above to
check) 

Since VGA emulation is the most demanding part of DOSBox in terms of actual
CPU usage, we'll start here. Increase the number of frames skipped (in
increments of one) by pressing CRTL+F8. Your CPU usage should decrease.
Go back one step and repeat this until the game runs fast enough for you.
Please note that this is a trade off: you lose in fluidity of video what you
gain in speed 

You can also try to disable the sound through the setup utility of the game
to further reduce load on your CPU. 



===================
9. The Config File:
===================

A config file can be generated by CONFIG.COM, which can be found on the 
internal dosbox Z: drive when you start up dosbox. Look in the internal 
programs section of the readme for usage of CONFIG.COM.
You can edit the generated configfile to customize DOSBox.

The file is divided into several sections (the names have [] around it). 
Some sections have options which you can set.
# and % indicate comment-lines. 
The generated configfile contains the current settings. You can alter them and
start DOSBox with the -conf switch to load the file and use these settings.

If no configfile is specified with the -conf switch, DOSBox will look in the
current directory for dosbox.conf. Then it will look for ~/.dosboxrc (Linux),
~\dosbox.conf (Win32) or "~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox Preferences" (MACOSX).



======================
10. The Language File:
======================

A language file can be generated by CONFIG.COM. 
Read it and you will hopefully understand how to change it. 
Start DOSBox with the -lang switch to use your new language file
or you can setup the filename in the config file in the [dosbox] section.
There's a language= entry that can be changed with the filename.
