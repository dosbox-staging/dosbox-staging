DOSBox v0.60

======
Usage:
======

dosbox [name] [-exit] [-c command] [-fullscreen] [-conf congfigfile] 
       [-lang languagefile]

  name   
        If "name" is a directory it'll mount that as the C: drive.
        If "name" is a executable it'll mount the directory of "name" 
        as the C: drive and execute "name".
    
  -exit  
        dosbox will exit after the "name" has been executed.

  -c command
        Runs the specified command before running "name". Multiple commands
        can be specified. Each command should start with -c though.

  -fullscreen
        Starts dosbox in fullscreenmode.

  -conf configfile
        Start dosbox with the options specified in "configfile".

  -lang languagefile
        Start dosbox using the language string specified in "languagefile".

Note: If a name/command/configfile/languagefile contains a space in it put
      the whole name/command/configfile/languagefile between quotes("example").

For example:

dosbox c:\atlantis\atlantis.exe -c "MOUNT D C:\SAVES"
  This would mount c:\atlanis as c:\ and run atlantis.exe.
  Before it does that it would first mount C:\SAVES as the D drive.

In Windows you can also drag directories/files on the dosbox executable.
 


==================
Internal Programs:
==================

dosbox supports most of the DOS commands found in command.com. 
In addition, the following commands are available: 

MOUNT Driveletter sourcedirectory [-t type] [-aspi] [-ioctl] 
      [-usecd number] [-size drivesize] [-label drivelabel]
MOUNT -cd
    
  Program to mount local directories as drives inside DOSBox.

  Driveletter
        The driveletter inside dosbox (eg. C)

  sourcedirectory
        The local directory you want to have inside dosbox.

  -t type
        Type of the mounted directory. Supported are: dir (standard),
        floppy, cdrom.

  -size drivesize
        Sets the size of the drive. 

  -label drivelabel
        Sets the name of the drive to "drivelabel". Usefull when a 
        program can't find it's cdrom.

  -aspi
        Forces to use the aspi layer. Only valid if mounting a cdrom under 
        Windows systems with an ASPI-Layer

  -ioctl   
        Forces to use ioctl commands. Only valid if mounting a cdrom under 
        windows which support them (Win2000/XP/NT).

  -usecd number
        Forces to use SDL cdrom support for drive number.
        Number can be found by -cd. Valid on all systems

  -cd
        Displays all detected cdrom drives and their numbers. Use with -usecd

  Note: It's possible to mount a local directory as cdrom drive. 
        Hardware support is then missing.

  Examples:
  1. To mount c:\floppy as a floppy : 
       mount a c:\floppy -t floppy
  2. To mount system cdrom drive E as cdrom drive D in dosbox:
       mount d e:\ -t cdrom
  3. To mount system cdrom drive at mountpoint /media/cdrom as cdrom drive D 
     in dosbox:
       mount d /media/cdrom -t cdrom -usecd 0

MEM
  Program to display the amount of free memory

CONFIG [-writeconf] [-writelang] localfile
  Write the current configuration or language settings to file.
  "localfile" is located on the local drive !!! 

LOADFIX
  Program to "eat up" memory. Usefull for old programs which don't expect much
  memory to be free.

For more information use the the /? command line switch with the programs.



=============
Special Keys:
=============

ALT-ENTER       Go full screen and back.
CTRL-F5	        Save a screenshot.
CTRL-F6	        Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
CTRL-F7	        Decrease frameskip.
CTRL-F8	        Increase frameskip.
CTRL-F9         Kill dosbox.
CTRL-F10        Capture/Release the mouse.
CTRL-F11        Slowdown emulation.
CTRL-F12        Speedup emulation.

====================
System requirements:
====================

Fast machine my guess would be pentium-2 400+ to get decent emulation
of games written for an 286 machine.
For protected mode games a 1 Ghz machine is recommended and don't expect
them to run fast though!! Be sure to read the next section on how to speed
it somewhat up.


================================
To run resource-demanding games: 
================================

DOSBox emulates the CPU, the sound and graphic cards, and some other
stuff, all at the same time. You can overclock DOSBox by using CTRL+F12, but
you'll be limited by the power of your actual CPU. You can see how much free
time your true CPU has by looking at the Task Manager in Windows 2000/XP and
the System Monitor in Windows 95/98/ME. Once 100% of your real CPU time is
used there is no further way to speed up DOSBox unless you reduce the load
generated by the non-CPU parts of DOSBox. 

So: 

Close every program but DOSBox 

Overclock DOSBox until 100% of your CPU is used (use the utilities above to
check) 

Since VGA emulation is the most demanding part of DOSBox in terms of actual
CPU usage, we'll start here. Increase the number of frames skipped (in
increments of one) by pressing CRTL+F8. Your CPU usage should decrease.
Go back one step and repeat this until the game runs fast enough for you.
Please note that this is a trade off: you lose in fluidity of video what you
gain in speed 

You can also try to disable the sound through the setup utility of the game
to further reduce load on your CPU.

FAQ:
====

Q: I've got a Z instead of a C at the prompt.
A: In DOSBox you can mount directories as drives
   in win32: mount c D:\ would give you a C in DOSBox which points
   at D:\ in win32
   in linux: mount c /home/username would give you a C in DOSBox
   which points at /home/username in Linux

Q: The mouse doesn't work.
A: Normally dosbox detects the mouse being used by a game, if you click on 
   the screen then it should get locked and work.
   Sometimes the dosbox mouse detection doesn't work with certain games, you
   might have to force to lock the mouse then with ctrl-F10.

Q: The sound stutters.
A: Your using too much cpu power to keep dosbox running at the current speed.
   You can either lower the cycles or skip frames or get a faster machine.

================
The Config File:
================

A config file can be generated by CONFIG.COM, edit it to customize DOSBox.
The file is divided in several sections (the names got [] around it). 
Some sections have options which you can set.
# and % indicate commentlines. 
The generated configfile contains the current settings. You can alter them and
start dosbox with the -conf switch to load the file and use these settings. 

==================
The Language File:
==================

A language file can be generated by CONFIG.COM. 
Read it and you will hopefuly understand how to change it. 
Start Dosbox with -lang switch to use your new language file
Or you can setup the filename in the config file in the [dosbox] section.
There's a language= entry that can be changed with the filename.


=================================
Building your own Version DOSBox:
=================================

Dowload the source.
Check the INSTALL in the source distribution.
