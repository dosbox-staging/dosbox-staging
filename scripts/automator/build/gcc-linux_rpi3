# GCC flags specific to the Raspberry Pi 3 series of SBC

# Note: NEON SIMD instructions for floating-point operations are 
# not generated by GCCâ€™s auto-vectorization pass unless 
# -funsafe-math-optimizations is also specified. This is because 
# NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE 754 standard for 
# some floating-point arithmetic operations, specifically 
# "denormal" values are treated as zero, so in these corner-cases, 
# the use of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of precision. 
# For our purposes, we expect to perform normal calculations and 
# thus accept this risk for release builds.
