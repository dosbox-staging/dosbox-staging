This is a wrapper for MSYS2 bash inside Windows GitHub CI environment.

Usage:

- name:  Step Name
  shell: python scripts\msys-bash.py {0}
  run:   echo "Hello"

GitHub documentation for specifying shell is here: [1], although it
leaves several VERY important details out:

- The first parameter (program name) in template shell invocation needs to be
  in PATH; absolute path will result in obscure C# exception.
- Name of temporary script file ends with a hardcoded extension matching the
  first parameter.
- There is some additional undocumented trickery about expansion of {0} in
  template (most probably it's something about formatting strings in C#).
- For some shells, an additional first line is prepended to the temporary
  script (but not for python!)
