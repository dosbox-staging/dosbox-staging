# IBM Music Feature annotated functions and structures

The accompanying assembly file "IMF rel. M102.00.01.asm" contains 
the annotated functions and structures upon which the "imfc.cpp" and 
"imfc_rom.c" sources are based (see the "/src/hardware" directory).

Tooling: the assembly was produced with the help of IDA Pro, which 
was used to create the functions and structures. From there, the 
assembly was ported (without IDA's assembly-to-C module) to C++.
