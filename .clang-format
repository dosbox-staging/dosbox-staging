# This file uses configuration options available in clang-format 15.0.
#
# More detailed description of all options:
# https://releases.llvm.org/15.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html
#
# Note that version of clang-format provided by your distribution might be
# newer and provide additional options, that won't work in 15.x.
#
# This style definition should only be understood as a hint
# for writing new code. The rules are still work-in-progress and do
# not yet exactly match the style we have in the existing code.


# Use tabs, but only for indentation (lining up blocks of code).
# Use space for indenting continuations (lining up long statements broken
# into several lines.
#
UseTab: ForIndentation
TabWidth: 8
IndentWidth: 8
ContinuationIndentWidth: 8

ColumnLimit: 80

# C/C++ Language specifics
#
Language: Cpp
Standard: c++20

# Align qualifiers with the type instead of the variable name
# int* var; // 'var' is a pointer-to-int
# int& var; // 'var' is a reference-to-int
# const int& var; // 'var' is a constant-reference-to-int
PointerAlignment: Left
ReferenceAlignment: Left
QualifierAlignment: Left

# The extra indent or outdent of class access modifiers, e.g. public:
#
AccessModifierOffset: -8

# Align parameters on the open bracket
#
# someLongFunction(argument1,
#                  argument2);
#
AlignAfterOpenBracket: Align

# If Consecutive, aligns consecutive C/C++ preprocessor macros.
#
# This will align the C/C++ preprocessor macros of consecutive lines. This will
# result in formattings like
#
# #define SHORT_NAME       42
# #define LONGER_NAME      0x007f
# #define EVEN_LONGER_NAME (2)
# #define foo(x)           (x * x)
# #define bar(y, z)        (y + z)
#
AlignConsecutiveMacros: Consecutive

# Don't align backslash character in macros, as it's unexpected during review
# and does not look right when user changes the tab size character in their editor.
#
AlignEscapedNewlines: DontAlign

##
# This will align the assignment operators of consecutive lines.
# enum Enum {
#    ONE   = 1,
#    TWO   = 2,
#    THREE = 3,
#    FOUR  = 4,
#    FIVE  = 5,
#    SIX   = 6,
#    SEVEN = 7
# };
AlignConsecutiveAssignments: Consecutive

##
#  the operator is un-indented so that the wrapped operand is aligned with the operand on the first line.
#
#  int aaa = bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
#          + ccccccccccccccc;
#
AlignOperands:  AlignAfterOperator

##
#   // Indents directives before the hash.
#
#   #if FOO
#     #if BAR
#       #include <foo>
#     #else
#       #include <other>
#     #endif
#   #endif
#
#   // This much easier to see what's happening versus:
#
#   #if FOO
#   #if BAR
#   #include <foo>
#   #else
#   #include <other>
#   #endif
#   #endif
#
IndentPPDirectives: None

# Always place function bodies on their own lines because
# it makes a mess when some are on the same line and others are
# on separate lines.
#
AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: Empty

# Short case labels in switch can be contracted to a single line
#
# switch (x) {
# case 42: return x;

# T foo() …
#
# NOT:
#
# template <typename T> T foo() …
#
AlwaysBreakTemplateDeclarations: Yes

# If true, always break before multiline string literals.
#
# This option means to make multiline string assignments nicely
# lined-up and reduce unnecessary breaks in string literal, e.g.:
#
# // true:
# very_long_var_name =
#         "bbbb"
#         "cccc";
# shortname =
#         "dddd"
#         "eeee";
#
# // false:
# very_long_var_name = "bbbb"
#                      "cccc";
# shortname = "dddd"
#             "eeee";
AlwaysBreakBeforeMultilineStrings: true

# Insert braces after control statements (``if``, ``else``, ``for``, ``do``,
#  and ``while``) in C++ unless the control statements are inside macro
#  definitions or the braces would enclose preprocessor directives.
#
#   == WARNING ==
#   Setting this option to `true` could lead to incorrect code formatting due
#   to clang-format's lack of complete semantic information. As such, extra
#   care should be taken to review code changes made by this option.
