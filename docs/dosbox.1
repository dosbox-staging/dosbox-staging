.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly documents
.BR "dosbox-staging" ", an x86/DOS emulator."
.LP
.RB "The optional " NAME " argument should be a DOS executable or a"
directory. If it is a dos executable (.com .exe .bat) the program will 
run automatically. If it is a directory, a DOS session will run with 
the directory mounted as C:\\.
.LP

.TP
.B \-securemode
.RB "Same as " \-noautoexec ", but adds " "config.com  \-securemode"

.SH FILES
Configuration and language files use a format similar to Windows .ini files. 
If no configfile is specified at the commandline, a file named
.BR dosbox.conf " (if present in the current directory) will be"
loaded automatically. If a configfile is specified at the commandline
that one will be used instead. If no configfile is specified or found
in the current directory
.RB " then dosbox will load one from " $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dosbox/ "
.RB " (which defaults to " ~/.config/dosbox/ "). It will try to create a
new default config file if it does not exist yet.
.SH "SPECIAL KEYS"
.TP 12m
.IP Alt+Enter
Switch between fullscreen and window mode.
.IP Alt+Pause
Pause/Unpause emulator.
.IP Ctrl+F1
Start the keymapper.
.IP Ctrl+F4
Swap mounted disk\(hyimage (only used with imgmount). Update directory cache
for all drives.
.IP Ctrl+F5
Save a screenshot.(png)
.IP Ctrl+F6
Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
.IP Ctrl+F7
Start/Stop recording video output to a zmbv file.
.IP Ctrl+F9
Kill dosbox.
.IP Ctrl+F10
Capture/Release the mouse.
.IP Ctrl+F11
Slow down emulation (Decrease number of cycles/s).
.IP Ctrl+F12
Speed up emulation (Increase number of cycles/s).
.IP Alt+F12
Unlock speed (turbo button).
.PP
These are the default keybindings. They can be changed in the keymapper.
.PP
Saved/recorded files can be found in current_directory/capture
(can be changed in the configfile).
.RB "The directory has to exist prior to starting " dosbox " else nothing"
gets saved/recorded !
.PP
.BR "Note: " "Once you increase your " dosbox " cycles beyond your computer's maximum
capacity, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the emulation.
This maximum will vary from computer to computer, there is no standard.
.SH "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS"
Fast machine. My guess would be Pentium\-2 400+ to get decent emulation
of games written for an 286 machine.
For protected mode games a 1 Ghz machine is recommended and don't expect
them to run fast though!! Be sure to read the next section on how to speed
it up somewhat.
.SS "To run resource\-demanding games"
.BR dosbox " emulates the CPU, the sound and graphic cards, and some other"
.RB " stuff, all at the same time. You can overclock " dosbox " by using Ctrl+F12, but"
you'll be limited by the power of your actual CPU. You can see how much free
time your true CPU has by various utils (top).  Once 100% of your real CPU time is
.RB "used there is no further way to speed up " dosbox " unless you reduce the load"
.RB "generated by the non\-CPU parts of " dosbox .
.PP
So:
.PP
.RB "Close every program but " dosbox .
.PP
.RB "Overclock  " dosbox " until 100% of your CPU is used. (Ctrl+F12)"
.PP
.RB "Since VGA emulation is the most demanding part of " dosbox " in terms of actual"
CPU usage, we'll start here. Increase the number of frames skipped (in
increments of one) by pressing Ctrl+F8. Your CPU usage should decrease.
Go back one step and repeat this until the game runs fast enough for you.
Please note that this is a trade off: you lose in fluidity of video what you
gain in speed.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Any configuration option can be override using an environment variable.
.RB "Environment variables starting with prefix " DOSBOX " are processed and
interpreted as follows:
.B DOSBOX_SECTIONNAME_PROPERTYNAME=value
.PP
.R For example, you can override render aspect this way:
.PP
.B $ DOSBOX_RENDER_ASPECT=false dosbox
.SH NOTES
.RB "While we hope that, one day, " dosbox " will run virtually all programs ever made for the PC..."
.RB "we are not there yet. At present, " dosbox " run on a 1.7 Gigahertz PC is roughly the equivalent of a 25MHz 386 PC."
While the 0.60 release has added support for "protected mode" allowing for more complex and recent programs, 
but note that this support is early in development and nowhere near as complete as the support for 386 real\-mode 
games (or earlier). Also note that "protected mode" games need substantially more resources and may 
.RB "require a much faster processor for you to run it properly in " dosbox .
