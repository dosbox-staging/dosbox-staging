.SH OPTIONS

Legacy single dash abbrevations still work for backwards compatibility.
.LP
--conf <config_file>     Start with the options specified in <config_file>.
                         Multiple configuration files can be specified.
                         Example: --conf conf1.conf --conf conf2.conf

--printconf              Print the location of the primary configuration file.

--editconf               Open the primary configuration file in a text editor.

--eraseconf              Delete the primary configuration file.

--noprimaryconf          Don't load or create the primary configuration file.

--nolocalconf            Don't load the local 'dosbox.conf' configuration file
                         if present in the current working directory.

--set <setting>=<value>  Set a configuration setting. Multiple configuration
                         settings can be specified. Example:
                         --set mididevice=fluidsynth --set soundfont=mysoundfont.sf2

--working-dir <path>     Set working directory to <path>. DOSBox will act as if
                         started from this directory.

--list-countries         List all supported countries with their numeric codes.
                         Codes are to be used in the 'country' config setting.

.SH "INTERNAL COMMANDS"

dosbox has a comprehensive internal help system which can be accessed by running HELP command.

dosbox supports most of the DOS commands found in COMMAND.COM. In addition, the
following extra commands are frequently used:

MOUNT

Program to mount local directories as drives inside dosbox.

IMGMOUNT

A utility to mount disk images and CD‐ROM images in dosbox.

CONFIG

Change dosbox internal configuration on the fly. May not work with all options.

LOADFIX

Program to reduce the amount of  memory available. Useful for old programs which 
don't expect much memory to be free.

RESCAN

Make dosbox reread the directory structure. Useful if you changed something 
on a mounted drive outside dosbox. Ctrl+F4 does this as well.

BOOT

BOOT will start floppy images or hard disk images independent of the operating system emulation
offered by dosbox. This will allow you to play booter floppies or boot to other operating 
systems inside dosbox.

.SH FILES

Configuration and language files use a format similar to Windows .ini files. 
If no configfile is specified at the commandline, a file named
.BR dosbox-staging.conf " (if present in the current directory) will be"
.RB " loaded automatically. We also will read and load " dosbox.conf " locally
.RB "too, if " dosbox-staging.conf " isn't present.
.LP
If a configfile is specified at the commandline
that one will be used instead. If no configfile is specified or found
in the current directory
.RB " then dosbox will load one from " $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dosbox/ "
.RB " (which defaults to " ~/.config/dosbox/ "). It will try to create a
new default config file if it does not exist yet.

.SH "SPECIAL KEYS"

.TP 12m
.IP Alt+Enter
Switch between fullscreen and window mode.
.IP Alt+Pause

.IP Ctrl+F4

for all drives.

.IP Ctrl+F11
Slow down emulation (Decrease number of cycles/s).
.IP Ctrl+F12
Speed up emulation (Increase number of cycles/s).
.IP Alt+F12

.PP
These are the default keybindings. They can be changed in the keymapper. More bindable actions can be found in the keymapper.
.PP

.SH NOTES

Saved/recorded files can be found in current_directory/capture
(can be changed in the configfile).
.RB "The directory has to exist prior to starting " dosbox " else nothing"
gets saved/recorded!
.PP
.RB "Once you increase your " dosbox " cycles beyond your computer's maximum
capacity, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the emulation.
This maximum will vary from computer to computer, there is no standard.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

Any configuration option can be override using an environment variable.
.RB "Environment variables starting with prefix " DOSBOX " are processed and
interpreted as follows:
.B DOSBOX_SECTIONNAME_PROPERTYNAME=value
.PP
.R For example, you can override Sound Blaster type to Sound Blaster Pro 2 this way:
.PP
.B $ DOSBOX_SBLASTER_SBTYPE=sbpro2 dosbox
