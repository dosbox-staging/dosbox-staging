bit_view
~~~~~~~~

The bit_view class is a wrapper around an 8-bit unsigned integer union member
that offers named access to one or more spans of bits.

For example:

union Register {
        uint8_t data = 0;
        bit_view<0, 1> first_bit;     // value is 0 or 1
        bit_view<1, 6> middle_6_bits; // value is 0 to 2^6-1
        bit_view<7, 1> last_bit;      // value is 0 or 1
};

It provides a view into a subset of its bits allowing them to be read,
written, assigned, flipped, cleared, and tested, without the need for
bit-twidling operations (such as shifting, masking, anding, or or'ing).

Constructing a bit_view is similar to C bitfields, however unlike C
bitfields, bit_views are free from undefined behavior and have been proven
using GCC's and Clang's undefined behavior sanitizers.

This gives us the benefits of bitfields without their specification downsides:
- they're succinct and clear to use
- they're just as fast as bitwise operators (maybe more so, being constexpr)
- they're self-documenting using their bit positions, sizes, and field names

Example usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assume we have a 8-bit audio control register that holds the card's:
- speaker-on state (off/on) starting at bit 0, using one bit
- stereo-output state (off/on) starting at bit 1, using one bit
- left channel pan starting at bit 2, using 3 bits
- right channel pan starting at bit 5, using 3 bits

bit_view's can make this register's elements self-documenting:

union AudioReg {
  uint8_t data = 0;
  bit_view<0, 1> speaker_on;
  bit_view<1, 1> stereo_output;
  bit_view<2, 3> left_pan;
  bit_view<5, 3> right_pan;
};

AudioReg reg = {data};

if (reg.speaker_on)
  enable_speaker();
else
  disable_speaker();

if (reg.stereo_output)
  stereo_pan(reg.left_pan, reg.right_pan)

8-bit limitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

bit_views are endian-safe as they're limited wrapping 8-bit registers,
which are not affected by the byte-ordering of larger multi-byte type.
(compile-type assertions guarantee this as well).

To use bit_views with larger types or registers, the type should be
accessible in it's explicit 8-bit parts (for example, a uint32_t can be
represented as an array of four uin8_t), each element of which can be
assigned to a bit_view-based union.

This is deliberate because the byte-ordering of the bit-view's data cannot
be assumed. For example, the byte ordering of a 16-bit register populated
within a DOS emulator will be little-endian, even when running on a
big-endian host, where as native data types on big-endian hardware will be
big-endian.
