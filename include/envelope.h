/*  Audio Envelope
 *  --------------
 *  This class applies a step-wise earned-volume envelope with a fixed
 * expiration period. The envelope is "earned" in the sense that the edge is
 * expanded when a sample meets or exceeds it. This helps minimize the
 * impact of unnatural waveforms that can whipsaw wildly, such as those
 * generated from digital machine noise or binary data.
 *
 *  Use
 *  ---
 *  1. Call Update(..) to provide the Envelope with information about the audio
 *     stream: the frame rate (in Hz), peak possible sample amplitude (from zero
 *     to 2^16 -1), the expansion phase duration in milliseconds that represents
 *     the shortest possible time the envelope will be expanded from zero to
 *     peak volume if the samples "earn" it (reasonable values are <30ms), and
 *     the desired expiration period in seconds (reasonable values are <60s).
 *
 *  2. Call Process(..), passing it samples in their natural 16-bit signed
 *     form. Note: when the envelope is fully expanded or has expired, this
 *     function becomes the a null-call, eliminating further overhead.
 *     To be clear - there are no runtime checks you need to perform to
 *     determine if you should use the envelope or not.  It simply goes
 *     dormant when done.
 *
 *  3. Call Reactivate() to perform another round of enveloping. Note that the
 *     characteristics about the envelope provided in the Update() call are
 *     retained and do not need to be provided after a reactivating.
 *
 *  By default, the evenlope does nothing; it needs to be Update()'d for it to
 *  do work.
