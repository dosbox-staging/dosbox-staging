/*  RW (Read/Write) Queue
 *  ---------------------
 *  A fixed-size thread-safe queue that blocks both the producer until space is
 *  available, and the consumer until items are available.
 *
 *  For optimal performance inside the rwqueue, blocking is accomplished by
 *  putting the thread into the waiting state, then waking it up via notify when
 *  the required conditions are met.
 *
 *  Producer and consumer thread(s) are expected to simply call the enqueue and
 *  dequeue methods directly without any thread state management.
