// This header wraps compiler-specific features, so they won't need to
// be hacked into the buildsystem.

// Function-like macro __has_cpp_attribute was introduced in C++20, but
// various compilers support it since C++11 as a language extension.
// Thanks to that we can use it for testing support for both language-defined
// and vendor-specific attributes.

#ifndef __has_cpp_attribute // for compatibility with non-supporting compilers
#define __has_cpp_attribute(x) 0
#endif

// When passing the -Wunused flag to GCC or Clang, entities that are unused by
// the program may be diagnosed.  The MAYBE_UNUSED attribute can be used to
// silence such diagnostics when the entity cannot be removed.
//
// The attribute may be applied to the declaration of a class, a typedef,
// a variable, a function or method, a function parameter, an enumeration,
// an enumerator, a non-static data member, or a label.

#if __has_cpp_attribute(maybe_unused)
#define MAYBE_UNUSED [[maybe_unused]]
#elif __has_cpp_attribute(gnu::unused)

//
// Provided for backwards-compatibility with old code; to be gradually
// replaced by new C++ attribute syntax.

// GCC_LIKELY macro is incorrectly named, because other compilers support
// this feature as well (e.g. Clang, Intel); leave it be for now, at
// least until full support for C++20 [[likely]] attribute will start arriving
// in new compilers.
//
// Note: '!!' trick is used, to convert non-boolean values to 1 or 0
// to prevent accidental incorrect usage (e.g. when user wraps macro
// around a pointer or an integer, expecting usual C semantics).

// XSTR and STR macros can be used turning defines into string literals:
//
// #define FOO 4
// printf("It's a " STR(FOO));  // prints "It's a FOO"
