// This header wraps compiler-specific features, so they won't need to
// be hacked into the buildsystem.

// Modern C++ compilers have better support for feature testing using GNU
// extension __has_attribute but C++20 introduces even better alternative:
// standard-defined __has_cpp_attribute, which will remove the need for
// defining C_HAS_* macros on a buildsystem level (at some point).

// The __attribute__ syntax is supported by GCC, Clang, and IBM compilers.
//
// TODO: C++11 introduces standard syntax for implementation-defined attributes,
//       it should allow for removal of C_HAS_ATTRIBUTE from the buildsystem.
//       However, the vast majority of GCC_ATTRIBUTEs in DOSBox code need
//       to be reviewed, as many of them seem to be incorrectly/unnecessarily
//       used.

#if C_HAS_ATTRIBUTE
#define GCC_ATTRIBUTE(x) __attribute__ ((x))
#else
#define GCC_ATTRIBUTE(x) /* attribute not supported */
#endif

// GCC_LIKELY macro is incorrectly named, because other compilers support
// this feature as well (e.g. Clang, Intel); leave it be for now, at
// least until full support for C++20 [[likely]] attribute will start arriving
// in new compilers.
//
// Note: '!!' trick is used, to convert non-boolean values to 1 or 0
// to prevent accidental incorrect usage (e.g. when user wraps macro
// around a pointer or an integer, expecting usual C semantics).
