Zero-Latency Soft Limiter
-------------------------
Given an input vector of floats, the Soft Limiter scales sequences that
exceed the bounds of a signed 16-bit signal.

This scale-down effect continues to be applied to subsequent sequences,
each time with less effect (provided even greater peaks aren't detected),
until the scale-down is complete - this period is known as 'Release' and
prevents a discontinuous jump in subsequent waveforms after the initial
sequence is scaled down.

Likewise, when a new large peak is detected, a polynomial is used to join
the tail of the prior sequence with the head of the current sequence.

Unique features:
 - Left and right channels are independently handled

 - Zero-latency: it does not require a pre-buffer or aprior knowledge to
   perform seamless scaling both on the front and back-end of the signal

 - Permits a pre-scaling factor be applied to the input samples
   before peak detection and scaling (see UpdateLevels).

 - Informs the user if the source signal was significantly under the allowed
   bounds in which case it suggests a suitable scale-up factor, or if excessive
   scaling was required it suggests a suitable scale-down factor.

Regarding the release duration:

Because audio should only be adjusted in small amounts to prevent
discontinuities, the release duration is a function of the magnitude of the
scale-down factor. The larger the scale-down, the more release periods are
needed; typically ranging from 10's of milliseconds to low-hundreds for large >
2x overages.

Use:

Instantiate the Soft Limiter object with the name of the channel that's
being operated on and the maximum number of frames you intend to pass into
the limiter in any given pass.

For example:
  SoftLimiter limiter("channel name", max_frames);

You can then repeatedly call:
  auto out = limiter.Process(in, num_frames);

Where:
 - 'in' is a std::vector<float>
 - 'num_frames' is some number of frames from zero up the maximum
   previously passed into the Soft Limiter's constructor
 - 'out' is a a std::vector<int16_t> of samples (num_frames * 2).

The limiter will either copy or soft-limit num_frames into the out vector.

The PrintStats function will indicate the peak amplitude as a percent
of the allow maximum detected during the entire processing period. It
will also provide mixer-level suggestions if the peak samples was
significantly below the maximum or if a significant percent of the overall
sequence required limiting.
