Comment:
 This prebuilt FreeDOS binary is included for compatibility reasons. Game
 installers and batch files rely on xcopy to perform critical steps. Without
 xcopy users can be left with broken installations. The binary is not compiled
 during the package build process and is distributed as-is from the upstream
 source.
