:CONFIG_FULLSCREEN
Start dosbox directly in fullscreen. (Press ALT-Enter to go back)
.
:CONFIG_FULLDOUBLE
Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox.
.
:CONFIG_FULLRESOLUTION
What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
  Using your monitor's native resolution (desktop) with aspect=true might give the best results.
  If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
  On Windows 10 with display scaling (Scale and layout) set to a value above 100%, it is recommended
  to use a lower full/windowresolution, in order to avoid window size problems.
.
:CONFIG_WINDOWRESOLUTION
Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
  (output=surface does not!)
.
:CONFIG_OUTPUT
What video system to use for output.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOLOCK
Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
.
:CONFIG_SENSITIVITY
Mouse sensitivity.
.
:CONFIG_WAITONERROR
Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
.
:CONFIG_PRIORITY
Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
  pause is only valid for the second entry.
.
:CONFIG_MAPPERFILE
File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the defaul value.
.
:CONFIG_USESCANCODES
Avoid usage of symkeys, might not work on all operating systems.
.
:CONFIG_LANGUAGE
Select another language file.
.
:CONFIG_MACHINE
The type of machine DOSBox tries to emulate.
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURES
Directory where things like wave, midi, screenshot get captured.
.
:CONFIG_MEMSIZE
Amount of memory DOSBox has in megabytes.
  This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
  though few games might require a higher value.
  There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
.
:CONFIG_FRAMESKIP
How many frames DOSBox skips before drawing one.
.
:CONFIG_ASPECT
Do aspect correction, if your output method doesn't support scaling this can slow things down!
.
:CONFIG_SCALER
Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. If 'forced' is appended,
  then the scaler will be used even if the result might not be desired.
  To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars,
  to fill the screen entirely, depending on your hardware, a different scaler/fullresolution might work.
.
:CONFIG_CORE
CPU Core used in emulation. auto will switch to dynamic if available and
appropriate.
.
:CONFIG_CPUTYPE
CPU Type used in emulation. auto is the fastest choice.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLES
Amount of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
  'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
                  It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
  'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually
                  need if 'auto' fails. (Example: fixed 4000).
  'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
                  handle.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEUP
Amount of cycles to decrease/increase with keycombos.(CTRL-F11/CTRL-F12)
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEDOWN
Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage.
.
:CONFIG_NOSOUND
Enable silent mode, sound is still emulated though.
.
:CONFIG_RATE
Mixer sample rate, setting any device's rate higher than this will probably lower their sound quality.
.
:CONFIG_BLOCKSIZE
Mixer block size, larger blocks might help sound stuttering but sound will also be more lagged.
.
:CONFIG_PREBUFFER
How many milliseconds of data to keep on top of the blocksize.
.
:CONFIG_MPU401
Type of MPU-401 to emulate.
.
:CONFIG_MIDIDEVICE
Device that will receive the MIDI data from MPU-401.
.
:CONFIG_MIDICONFIG
Special configuration options for the device driver. This is usually the id of the device you want to use
  (find the id with mixer/listmidi).
  Or in the case of coreaudio, you can specify a soundfont here.
  See the README/Manual for more details.
.
:CONFIG_SBTYPE

:CONFIG_OPLMODE
Type of OPL emulation. On 'auto' the mode is determined by sblaster type. All OPL modes are Adlib-compatible, except for 'cms'.
.
:CONFIG_OPLEMU
Provider for the OPL emulation. compat might provide better quality (see oplrate as well).
.
:CONFIG_OPLRATE
Sample rate of OPL music emulation. Use 49716 for highest quality (set the mixer rate accordingly).
.
:CONFIG_GUS
Enable the Gravis Ultrasound emulation.
.
:CONFIG_GUSRATE

.
:CONFIG_GUSDMA
The DMA channel of the Gravis Ultrasound.
.
:CONFIG_ULTRADIR

there should be a MIDI directory that contains
the patch files for GUS playback. Patch sets used
with Timidity should work fine.
.
:CONFIG_PCSPEAKER
Enable PC-Speaker emulation.
.
:CONFIG_PCRATE
Sample rate of the PC-Speaker sound generation.
.
:CONFIG_TANDY
Enable Tandy Sound System emulation. For 'auto', emulation is present only if machine is set to 'tandy'.
.
:CONFIG_TANDYRATE
Sample rate of the Tandy 3-Voice generation.
.
:CONFIG_DISNEY
Enable Disney Sound Source emulation. (Covox Voice Master and Speech Thing compatible).

2axis (supports two joysticks),
4axis (supports one joystick, first joystick used),
4axis_2 (supports one joystick, second joystick used),

none disables joystick emulation.
auto chooses emulation depending on real joystick(s).
(Remember to reset dosbox's mapperfile if you saved it earlier)
.
:CONFIG_TIMED
enable timed intervals for axis. Experiment with this option, if your joystick drifts (away).
.
:CONFIG_AUTOFIRE
continuously fires as long as you keep the button pressed.
.
:CONFIG_SWAP34

:PROGRAM_INTRO_CDROM
[2J[32;1mHow to mount a Real/Virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox:[0m
DOSBox provides CD-ROM emulation on several levels.

The [33mbasic[0m level works on all CD-ROM drives and normal directories.
It installs MSCDEX and marks the files read-only.
Usually this is enough for most games:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom[0m   or   [34;1mmount d C:\example -t cdrom[0m
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:
[34;1mmount d C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[0m

The [33mnext[0m level adds some low-level support.
Therefore only works on CD-ROM drives:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd [33m0[0m

The [33mlast[0m level of support depends on your Operating System:
For [1mWindows 2000[0m, [1mWindows XP[0m and [1mLinux[0m:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd [33m0 [34m-ioctl[0m
For [1mWindows 9x[0m with a ASPI layer installed:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd [33m0 [34m-aspi[0m

Replace [0;31mD:\[0m with the location of your CD-ROM.
Replace the [33;1m0[0m in [34;1m-usecd [33m0[0m with the number reported for your CD-ROM if you type:
[34;1mmount -cd[0m
