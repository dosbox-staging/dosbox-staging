:CONFIG_FULLSCREEN
Start DOSBox directly in fullscreen.
Press Alt-Enter to switch back to window.
.
:CONFIG_DISPLAY
Number of display to use; values depend on OS and user settings.
.
:CONFIG_VSYNC
Vertical sync setting not implemented (setting ignored)
.
:CONFIG_FULLRESOLUTION
What resolution to use for fullscreen: 'original', 'desktop'
or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
.
:CONFIG_WINDOWRESOLUTION
Set window size to be used when running in windowed mode:
  default:   Select the best option based on your
             environment and other settings.
  original:  Resize window to the resolution picked by
             the emulated program.
  resizable: Make the emulator window resizable.
             This is an experimental option, works only with
             output=opengl and glshader=sharp (or none)
  <custom>:  Scale the window content to the indicated
             dimensions, in WxH format. For example: 1024x768.
             Scaling is not performed for output=surface.
.
:CONFIG_OUTPUT
What video system to use for output.
.
:CONFIG_TEXTURE_RENDERER
Choose a renderer driver when using a texture output mode.
Use texture_renderer=auto for an automatic choice.
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURE_MOUSE
Choose a mouse control method:
   onclick:        The mouse will be captured after the first
                   click inside the window.
   onstart:        The mouse is captured immediately on start
                   (similar to real DOS).
   seamless:       The mouse can move seamlessly in and out of DOSBox
                   window and cannot be captured.
   nomouse:        The mouse is disabled and hidden without any
                   input sent to the game.
Choose how middle-clicks are handled (second parameter):
   middlegame:     Middle-clicks are sent to the game
                   (Ctrl-F10 uncaptures the mouse).
   middlerelease:  Middle-clicks are used to uncapture the mouse
                   (not sent to the game). However, middle-clicks
                   will be sent to the game in fullscreen or when
                   seamless control is set.
                   Ctrl-F10 will also uncapture the mouse.
Defaults (if not present or incorrect): seamless middlerelease
.
:CONFIG_SENSITIVITY
Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
.
:CONFIG_RAW_MOUSE_INPUT
Enable this setting to bypass your operating system's mouse
acceleration and sensitivity settings. This works in
fullscreen or when the mouse is captured in window mode.
.
:CONFIG_WAITONERROR
Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
.
:CONFIG_PRIORITY
Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
pause is only valid for the second entry.
.
:CONFIG_MAPPERFILE
File used to load/save the key/event mappings from.
Resetmapper only works with the default value.
.
:CONFIG_SCREENSAVER
Use 'allow' or 'block' to override the SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER
environment variable (which usually blocks the OS screensaver
while the emulator is running).
.
:CONFIG_LANGUAGE
Select another language file.
.
:CONFIG_MACHINE
The type of machine DOSBox tries to emulate.
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURES
Directory where things like wave, midi, screenshot get captured.
.
:CONFIG_MEMSIZE
Amount of memory DOSBox has in megabytes.
This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
though few games might require a higher value.
There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
.
:CONFIG_STARTUP_VERBOSITY
Controls verbosity prior to displaying the program:
            | Splash | Welcome | Early stdout
high        |  yes   |   yes   |     yes
medium      |  no    |   yes   |     yes
low         |  no    |   no    |     yes
quiet       |  no    |   no    |     no
splash_only |  yes   |   no    |     no
auto        | 'low' if exec or dir is passed, otherwise 'high'
.
:CONFIG_FRAMESKIP
How many frames DOSBox skips before drawing one.
.
:CONFIG_ASPECT
Scales the vertical resolution to produce a 4:3 display aspect
ratio, matching that of the original standard-definition monitors
for which the majority of DOS games were designed. This setting
only affects video modes that use non-square pixels, such as
320x200 or 640x400; where as square-pixel modes, such as 640x480
and 800x600, will be displayed as-is.
.
:CONFIG_MONOCHROME_PALETTE
Select default palette for monochrome display.
Works only when emulating hercules or cga_mono.
You can also cycle through available colours using F11.
.
:CONFIG_SCALER
Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes.
If 'forced' is appended, then the scaler will be used even if
the result might not be desired.
Note that some scalers may use black borders to fit the image
within your configured display resolution. If this is
undesirable, try either a different scaler or enabling
fullresolution output.
.
:CONFIG_GLSHADER
Either 'none' or a GLSL shader name. Works only with
OpenGL output.  Can be either an absolute path, a file
in the 'glshaders' subdirectory of the DOSBox
configuration directory, or one of the built-in shaders:
advinterp2x, advinterp3x, advmame2x, advmame3x,
crt-easymode-flat, crt-fakelottes-flat, rgb2x, rgb3x,
scan2x, scan3x, tv2x, tv3x, sharp (default).
.
:CONFIG_CORE
CPU Core used in emulation. auto will switch to dynamic if available and
appropriate.
.
:CONFIG_CPUTYPE
CPU Type used in emulation. auto is the fastest choice.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLES
Amount of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
  'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
                  It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
  'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually
                  need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
  'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
                  handle.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEUP
Amount of cycles to decrease/increase with keycombos.(CTRL-F11/CTRL-F12)
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEDOWN
Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage.
.
:CONFIG_NOSOUND
Enable silent mode, sound is still emulated though.
.
:CONFIG_RATE
Mixer sample rate, setting any device's rate higher than this will probably lower their sound quality.
.
:CONFIG_BLOCKSIZE
Mixer block size, larger blocks might help sound stuttering but sound will also be more lagged.
.
:CONFIG_PREBUFFER
How many milliseconds of data to keep on top of the blocksize.
.
:CONFIG_MIDIDEVICE
Device that will receive the MIDI data (from the emulated MIDI
interface - MPU-401). Choose one of the following:
'fluidsynth', to use the built-in MIDI synthesizer. See the
       [fluidsynth] section for detailed configuration.
'mt32', to use the built-in Roland MT-32 synthesizer.
       See the [mt32] section for detailed configuration.
'auto', to use the first working external MIDI player. This
       might be a software synthesizer or physical device.
.
:CONFIG_MIDICONFIG
Configuration options for the selected MIDI interface.
This is usually the id or name of the MIDI synthesizer you want
to use (find the id/name with DOS command 'mixer /listmidi').
- This option has no effect when using the built-in synthesizers
  (mididevice = fluidsynth or mt32).
- When using ALSA, use Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list open
  MIDI ports, and select one (for example 'midiconfig=14:0'
  for sequencer client 14, port 0).
- If you're using a physical Roland MT-32 with revision 0 PCB,
  the hardware may require a delay in order to prevent its
  buffer from overflowing. In that case, add 'delaysysex',
  for example: 'midiconfig=2 delaysysex'.
See the README/Manual for more details.
.
:CONFIG_MPU401
Type of MPU-401 to emulate.
.
:CONFIG_SOUNDFONT
Path to a SoundFont file in .sf2 format. You can use an
absolute or relative path, or the name of an .sf2 inside
the 'soundfonts' directory within your DOSBox configuration
directory.
An optional percentage will scale the SoundFont's volume.
For example: 'soundfont.sf2 50' will attenuate it by 50 percent.
The scaling percentage can range from 1 to 500.
.
:CONFIG_MODEL
Model of synthesizer to use. The default (auto) prefers CM-32L
if both sets of ROMs are provided. For early Sierra games and Dune 2
it's recommended to use 'mt32', while newer games typically made
use of the CM-32L's extra sound effects (use 'auto' or 'cm32l')
.
:CONFIG_ROMDIR
The directory holding the required MT-32 and/or CM-32L ROMs
named as follows:
  MT32_CONTROL.ROM or CM32L_CONTROL.ROM - control ROM files(s).
  MT32_PCM.ROM or CM32L_PCM.ROM - PCM ROM file(s).
The directory can be absolute or relative, or leave it blank to
use the 'mt32-roms' directory in your DOSBox configuration
directory, followed by checking other common system locations.

Enable PC-Speaker emulation.
.
:CONFIG_PCRATE
Sample rate of the PC-Speaker sound generation.
.
:CONFIG_ZERO_OFFSET
Neutralizes and prevents the PC speaker's DC-offset from harming other sources.
'auto' enables this for non-Windows systems and disables it on Windows.

:PROGRAM_INTRO_CDROM
[2J[32;1mHow to mount a virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox:[0m
DOSBox provides CD-ROM emulation on several levels.

This works on all normal directories, installs MSCDEX and marks the files
read-only. Usually this is enough for most games:

[34;1mmount D C:\example -t cdrom[0m

If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:

[34;1mmount D C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[0m

Additionally, you can use IMGMOUNT to mount ISO images or CUE files:

[34;1mimgmount D C:\cd.iso -t cdrom[0m

.
:PROGRAM_BOOT_PRINT_ERROR
This command boots DOSBox from either a floppy or hard disk image.

For this command, one can specify a succession of floppy disks swappable
by pressing Ctrl-F4, and -l specifies the mounted drive to boot from.  If
no drive letter is specified, this defaults to booting from the A drive.
The only bootable drive letters are A, C, and D.  For booting from a hard
drive (C or D), the image should have already been mounted using the
[34;1mIMGMOUNT[0m command.

The syntax of this command is:

[34;1mBOOT [diskimg1.img diskimg2.img] [-l driveletter][0m
