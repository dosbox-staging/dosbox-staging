  <custom>:  Specify a custom rate as a whole or decimal value greater than 23.000.
.
:CONFIG_VSYNC
Synchronize with display refresh rate if supported. This can
reduce flickering and tearing, but may also impact performance.
.
:CONFIG_VSYNC_SKIP
Number of microseconds to allow rendering to block before skipping the next frame. 0 disables this and will always render.
.
:CONFIG_PRESENTATION_MODE
Optionally select the frame presentation mode:

environment variable (which usually blocks the OS screensaver
while the emulator is running).
.
:CONFIG_LANGUAGE
Select a language to use: de, en, es, fr, it, nl, pl, and ru
Notes: This setting will override the 'LANG' environment, if set.

host:     Match the DOS rate to the host rate (see 'host_rate' setting).
<value>:  Sets the rate to an exact value, between 24.000 and 1000.000 (Hz).
We recommend the 'default' rate; otherwise test and set on a per-game basis.
.
:CONFIG_VESA_MODES
Controls the selection of VESA 1.2 and 2.0 modes offered:
  compatible   A tailored selection that maximizes game compatibility.
               This is recommended along with 4 or 8 MB of video memory.
  halfline     Supports the low-resolution halfline VESA 2.0 mode used by
               Extreme Assault. Use only if needed, as it's not S3 compatible.
  all          Offers all modes for a given video memory size, however
               some games may not use them properly (flickering) or may need
               more system memory (mem = ) to use them.
.
:CONFIG_SPEED_MODS
Permit changes known to improve performance. Currently no games are known
to be affected by this. Please file a bug with the project if you find a
game that fails when this is set to true so we will list them here.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOEXEC_SECTION
How autoexec sections are handled from multiple config files.
join      : combines them into one big section (legacy behavior).
overwrite : use the last one encountered, like other conf settings.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOMOUNT
Mounts 'drives/[c]' directories as drives on startup, where [c] is
a lower-case drive letter from a to y.  The 'drives' folder can be
provided relative to the current directory or via built-in resources.
Mount settings can be optionally provided using a [c].conf file along-
-side the drive's directory, with content as follows:
  [drive]
  type    = dir, overlay, floppy, or cdrom
  label   = custom_label
  path    = path-specification, ie: path = %%path%%;c:\tools
  override_drive = mount the directory to this drive instead (default empty)
  verbose = true or false
.
:CONFIG_STARTUP_VERBOSITY

.
:CONFIG_ASPECT
Scales the vertical resolution to produce a 4:3 display aspect
ratio, matching that of the original standard-definition monitors
for which the majority of DOS games were designed. This setting
only affects video modes that use non-square pixels, such as
320x200 or 640x400; where as square-pixel modes, such as 640x480
and 800x600, will be displayed as-is.
.

  ibm5153 [C]:   Emulation of the actual color output of an IBM 5153 monitor with
                 a unique Contrast control that dims non-bright colors only
                 (0 to 100; defaults to 100).
  agi-amiga-v1, agi-amiga-v2, agi-amiga-v3:
                 Palettes used by the Amiga ports of Sierra AGI games

  colodore-sat:  Colodore palette with 20% more saturation.
  dga16:         A modern take on the canonical CGA palette with dialed back contrast.
You can also set custom colors by specifying 16 space or comma separated color values,
either as 3 or 6-digit hex codes (e.g. #f00 or #ff0000 for full red), or decimal
RGB triplets (e.g. (255, 0, 255) for magenta).
.
:CONFIG_SCALER
Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes.
If 'forced' is appended, then the scaler will be used even if
the result might not be desired.
Note that some scalers may use black borders to fit the image
within your configured display resolution. If this is
undesirable, try either a different scaler or enabling
fullresolution output.
.
:CONFIG_GLSHADER
Either 'none' or a GLSL shader name. Works only with
OpenGL output.  Can be either an absolute path, a file
in the 'glshaders' subdirectory of the DOSBox
configuration directory, one of the bundled shaders:
advinterp2x, advinterp3x, advmame2x, advmame3x,
crt-easymode-flat, crt-fakelottes-flat, rgb2x, rgb3x,
scan2x, scan3x, tv2x, tv3x, sharp (default).
.
:CONFIG_COMPOSITE

Note: Fine-tune the settings below (ie: hue) using the composite hotkeys.
      Then read the new settings from your console and enter them here.
.
:CONFIG_ERA
Era of composite technology. When 'auto', PCjr uses new and CGA/Tandy use old.

.
:CONFIG_CYCLES
Number of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
  'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
                  It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
  'fixed #number' will set a fixed number of cycles. This is what you usually
                  need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
  'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
                  handle.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEUP

.
:CONFIG_NEGOTIATE
Let the system audio driver negotiate (possibly) better rate and blocksize settings.
.
:CONFIG_COMPRESSOR

  off:         No crossfeed (default).
  on:          Enable crossfeed (at strength 40).
  <strength>:  Set crossfeed strength from 0 to 100, where 0 means no crossfeed (off)
               and 100 full crossfeed (effectively turning stereo content into mono).
Note: You can set per-channel crossfeed via mixer commands.
.
:CONFIG_REVERB
Enable reverb globally to add a sense of space to the sound:
  off:     No reverb (default).
  on:      Enable reverb (medium preset).
  tiny:    Simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a room;
           specifically designed for small-speaker audio systems
           (PC Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and LPT DAC devices).
  small:   Adds a subtle sense of space; good for games that use a single
           synth channel (typically OPL) for both music and sound effects.
  medium:  Medium room preset that works well with a wide variety of games.
  large:   Large hall preset recommended for games that use separate
           channels for music and digital audio.
  huge:    A stronger variant of the large hall preset; works really well
           in some games with more atmospheric soundtracks.
Note: You can fine-tune per-channel reverb levels via mixer commands.
.
:CONFIG_CHORUS
Enable chorus globally to add a sense of stereo movement to the sound:
  off:     No chorus (default).
  on:      Enable chorus (normal preset).
  light:   A light chorus effect (especially suited for
           synth music that features lots of white noise.)
  normal:  Normal chorus that works well with a wide variety of games.
  strong:  An obvious and upfront chorus effect.
Note: You can fine-tune per-channel chorus levels via mixer commands.
.
:CONFIG_MIDIDEVICE

interface - MPU-401). Choose one of the following:
'fluidsynth', to use the built-in MIDI synthesizer. See the
       [fluidsynth] section for detailed configuration.
'mt32', to use the built-in Roland MT-32 synthesizer.
       See the [mt32] section for detailed configuration.
'auto', to use the first working external MIDI player. This
       might be a software synthesizer or physical device.
.
:CONFIG_MIDICONFIG
Configuration options for the selected MIDI interface.
This is usually the id or name of the MIDI synthesizer you want
to use (find the id/name with DOS command 'mixer /listmidi').
- This option has no effect when using the built-in synthesizers
  (mididevice = fluidsynth or mt32).
- When using ALSA, use Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list open
  MIDI ports, and select one (for example 'midiconfig=14:0'
  for sequencer client 14, port 0).
- If you're using a physical Roland MT-32 with revision 0 PCB,
  the hardware may require a delay in order to prevent its
  buffer from overflowing. In that case, add 'delaysysex',
  for example: 'midiconfig=2 delaysysex'.
See the README/Manual for more details.
.
:CONFIG_MPU401
Type of MPU-401 to emulate.
.
:CONFIG_SOUNDFONT

absolute or relative path, or the name of an .sf2 inside
the 'soundfonts' directory within your DOSBox configuration
directory.
Note: The optional volume scaling percentage after the filename
has been deprecated. Please use a mixer command instead to
change the FluidSynth audio channel's volume, e.g.:
  MIXER FSYNTH 200
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_CHORUS
Chorus effect: 'auto', 'on', 'off', or custom values.
When using custom values:

  - voice-count is an integer from 0 to 99.
  - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 10.0
  - speed is a decimal, measured in Hz, from 0.1 to 5.0
  - depth is a decimal from 0.0 to 21.0
  - modulation-wave is either 'sine' or 'triangle'
  For example: chorus = 3 1.2 0.3 8.0 sine
Note: You can disable the FluidSynth chorus and enable the
mixer-level chorus on the FluidSynth channel instead, or
enable both chorus effects at the same time. Whether this
sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the chorus settings
being used.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_REVERB
Reverb effect: 'auto', 'on', 'off', or custom values.
When using custom values:
  All four must be provided in-order and space-separated.

  - damping is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
  - width is a decimal from 0.0 to 100.0
  - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
  For example: reverb = 0.61 0.23 0.76 0.56
Note: You can disable the FluidSynth reverb and enable the
mixer-level reverb on the FluidSynth channel instead, or
enable both reverb effects at the same time. Whether this
sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the reverb settings
being used.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_FILTER

:CONFIG_NE2000
Enable emulation of a Novell NE2000 network card on a software-based
network (using libslirp) with properties as follows:
 - 255.255.255.0 : Subnet mask of the 10.0.2.0 virtual LAN.
 - 10.0.2.2      : IP of the gateway and DHCP service.
 - 10.0.2.3      : IP of the virtual DNS server.
 - 10.0.2.15     : First IP provided by DHCP, your IP!
Note: Inside DOS, setting this up requires an NE2000 packet driver,
      DHCP client, and TCP/IP stack. You might need port-forwarding
      from the host into the DOS guest, and from your router to your
      host when acting as the server for multiplayer games.
.
:CONFIG_NICBASE
The base address of the NE2000 card.
Note: Addresses 220 and 240 might not be available as they're assigned
      to the Sound Blaster and Gravis UltraSound by default.
.
:CONFIG_NICIRQ
The interrupt used by the NE2000 card.
Note: IRQs 3 and 5 might not be available as they're assigned
      to 'serial2' and the Gravis UltraSound by default.
.
:CONFIG_MACADDR
The MAC address of the NE2000 card.
.
:CONFIG_TCP_PORT_FORWARDS
Forwards one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
The format is:
  port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
  This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
  host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
  This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest
A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
  start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
  This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
  hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
  This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest
Notes:
  - If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
  - If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
  - If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
.
:CONFIG_UDP_PORT_FORWARDS
Forwards one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
The format is the same as for TCP port forwards.
.

:SHELL_CMD_AUTOTYPE_HELP_LONG
Performs scripted keyboard entry into a running DOS game.

Usage:
  [color=green]autotype[reset] -list
  [color=green]autotype[reset] [-w [color=white]WAIT[reset]] [-p [color=white]PACE[reset]] [color=cyan]BUTTONS[reset]

Where:
  [color=white]WAIT[reset]    is the number of seconds to wait before typing begins (max of 30).
  [color=white]PACE[reset]    is the number of seconds before each keystroke (max of 10).
  [color=cyan]BUTTONS[reset] is one or more space-separated buttons.

Notes:
  The [color=cyan]BUTTONS[reset] supplied in the command will be autotyped into running DOS games
  after they start. Autotyping begins after [color=cyan]WAIT[reset] seconds, and each button is
  entered every [color=white]PACE[reset] seconds. The [color=cyan],[reset] character inserts an extra [color=white]PACE[reset] delay.
  [color=white]WAIT[reset] and [color=white]PACE[reset] default to 2 and 0.5 seconds respectively if not specified.
  A list of all available button names can be obtained using the -list option.

Examples:
  [color=green]autotype[reset] -list
  [color=green]autotype[reset] -w [color=white]1[reset] -p [color=white]0.3[reset] [color=cyan]up enter , right enter[reset]

:PROGRAM_INTRO_CDROM_WINDOWS
[2J[32;1mHow to mount a real/virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox:[0m
DOSBox provides CD-ROM emulation on two levels.

The [33mbasic[0m level works on all normal directories, which installs MSCDEX
and marks the files read-only. Usually this is enough for most games:
[34;1mmount D C:\example -t cdrom[0m
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:
[34;1mmount D C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[0m

The [33mnext[0m level adds some low-level support.
Therefore only works on CD-ROM drives:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd [33m0[0m
Replace [0;31mD:\[0m with the location of your CD-ROM.
Replace the [33;1m0[0m in [34;1m-usecd [33m0[0m with the number reported for your CD-ROM if you type:
[34;1mmount -listcd[0m

Additionally, you can use imgmount to mount iso or cue/bin images:
[34;1mimgmount D C:\cd.iso -t cdrom[0m
[34;1mimgmount D C:\cd.cue -t cdrom[0m

[2J[32;1mHow to mount a real/virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox:[0m
DOSBox provides CD-ROM emulation on two levels.

The [33mbasic[0m level works on all normal directories, which installs MSCDEX
and marks the files read-only. Usually this is enough for most games:
[34;1mmount D ~/example -t cdrom[0m
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:
[34;1mmount D ~/example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[0m

The [33mnext[0m level adds some low-level support.
Therefore only works on CD-ROM drives:
[34;1mmount d [0;31m~/example[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd [33m0[0m

Replace [0;31m~/example[0m with the location of your CD-ROM.
Replace the [33;1m0[0m in [34;1m-usecd [33m0[0m with the number reported for your CD-ROM if you type:
[34;1mmount -listcd[0m

Additionally, you can use imgmount to mount iso or cue/bin images:
[34;1mimgmount D ~/cd.iso -t cdrom[0m
[34;1mimgmount D ~/cd.cue -t cdrom[0m

:SHELL_CMD_KEYB_HELP_LONG
Configures a keyboard for a specific language.

Usage:
  [color=green]keyb[reset] [color=cyan][LANGCODE][reset]
  [color=green]keyb[reset] [color=cyan]LANGCODE[reset] [color=white]CODEPAGE[reset] [CODEPAGEFILE]

Where:
  [color=cyan]LANGCODE[reset]     is a language code or keyboard layout ID.
  [color=white]CODEPAGE[reset]     is a code page number, such as [color=white]437[reset] and [color=white]850[reset].
  CODEPAGEFILE is a file containing information for a code page.

Notes:
  Running [color=green]keyb[reset] without an argument shows the currently loaded keyboard layout
  and code page. It will change to [color=cyan]LANGCODE[reset] if provided, optionally with a
  [color=white]CODEPAGE[reset] and an additional CODEPAGEFILE to load the specified code page
  number and code page file if provided. This command is especially useful if
  you use a non-US keyboard, and [color=cyan]LANGCODE[reset] can also be set in the configuration
  file under the [dos] section using the "keyboardlayout = [color=cyan]LANGCODE[reset]" setting.

Examples:
  [color=green]KEYB[reset]
  [color=green]KEYB[reset] [color=cyan]uk[reset]
  [color=green]KEYB[reset] [color=cyan]sp[reset] [color=white]850[reset]

  which show either the "[color=white]Packed File Corrupt[reset]" or "[color=white]Not enough memory"[reset] (e.g.,
  from some 1980's games such as California Games II) error message when run.
  Running [color=green]loadfix[reset] without an argument simply allocates memory for your game
  to run; you can free the memory with either /d or /f option when it finishes.

Examples:
  [color=green]loadfix[reset] [color=cyan]mygame[reset] [color=white]args[reset]
