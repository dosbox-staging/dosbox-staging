The type of machine DOSBox tries to emulate.
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURES
Directory where things like wave, midi, screenshot get captured.
.
:CONFIG_MEMSIZE

though few games might require a higher value.
There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
.
:CONFIG_MCB_FAULT_STRATEGY
How software-corrupted memory chain blocks should be handled:
  deny:    Quit (and report) when faults are detected (default).
  repair:  Repair (and report) faults using adjacent chain blocks.
  report:  Report faults but otherwise proceed as-is.
  allow:   Allow faults to go unreported (hardware behavior).
The default (deny) is recommended unless a game is failing with MCB corruption
errors.
.

  halfline     Supports the low-resolution halfline VESA 2.0 mode used by
               Extreme Assault. Use only if needed, as it's not S3 compatible.
  all          Offers all modes for a given video memory size, however
               some games may not use them properly (flickering) or may need
               more system memory (mem = ) to use them.
.
:CONFIG_SPEED_MODS
Permit changes known to improve performance. Currently no games are known
to be affected by this. Please file a bug with the project if you find a
game that fails when this is set to true so we will list them here.
.

join      : combines them into one big section (legacy behavior).
overwrite : use the last one encountered, like other conf settings.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOMOUNT
Mounts 'drives/[c]' directories as drives on startup, where [c] is
a lower-case drive letter from a to y.  The 'drives' folder can be
provided relative to the current directory or via built-in resources.
Mount settings can be optionally provided using a [c].conf file along-
-side the drive's directory, with content as follows:
  [drive]

.
:CONFIG_FRAMESKIP
Consider capping frame-rates using the '[sdl] host_rate' setting.
.
:CONFIG_ASPECT
Scales the vertical resolution to produce a 4:3 display aspect
ratio, matching that of the original standard-definition monitors
for which the majority of DOS games were designed. This setting
only affects video modes that use non-square pixels, such as
320x200 or 640x400; where as square-pixel modes, such as 640x480
and 800x600, will be displayed as-is.
.
:CONFIG_MONOCHROME_PALETTE
Select default palette for monochrome display.
Works only when emulating hercules or cga_mono.
You can also cycle through available colours using F11.
.
:CONFIG_CGA_COLORS
Sets the interpretation of CGA RGBI colors. Affects all machine types capable
of displaying CGA or better graphics. Built-in presets:
  default:       The canonical CGA palette, as emulated by VGA adapters
                 (default).
  tandy [BL]:    Emulation of an idealised Tandy monitor with adjustable
                 brown level. The brown level can be provided as an optional
                 second parameter (0 - red, 50 - brown, 100 - dark yellow;
                 defaults to 50). E.g. tandy 100

                 AGI-interpreter.
  scumm-amiga:   Palette used by the Amiga ports of LucasArts EGA games.
  colodore:      Commodore 64 inspired colors based on the Colodore palette.
  colodore-sat:  Colodore palette with 20% more saturation.
  dga16:         A modern take on the canonical CGA palette with dialed back
                 contrast.
You can also set custom colors by specifying 16 space or comma separated color
values, either as 3 or 6-digit hex codes (e.g. #f00 or #ff0000 for full red),
or decimal RGB triplets (e.g. (255, 0, 255) for magenta). The 16 colors are
ordered as follows:
black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, light-grey, dark-grey,
light-blue, light-green, light-cyan, light-red, light-magenta, yellow,
and white.
Their default values, shown here in 6-digit hex code format, are:

#5555ff #55ff55 #55ffff #ff5555 #ff55ff #ffff55 and #ffffff, respectively.
.
:CONFIG_SCALER
Software scalers are deprecated in favour of hardware-accelerated options:
 - If you used the normal2x/3x scalers, set a desired 'windowresolution' instead.
 - If you used an advanced scaler, consider one of the 'glshader' options instead.
.
:CONFIG_GLSHADER
Either 'none' or a GLSL shader name. Works only with
OpenGL output.  Can be either an absolute path, a file
in the 'glshaders' subdirectory of the DOSBox
configuration directory, one of the bundled shaders:
advinterp2x, advinterp3x, advmame2x, advmame3x,
crt-easymode-flat, crt-fakelottes-flat, rgb2x, rgb3x,
scan2x, scan3x, tv2x, tv3x, sharp (default).
.

appropriate.
.
:CONFIG_CPUTYPE
CPU Type used in emulation. auto is the fastest choice.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLES
Number of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
  'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
                  It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
  'fixed #number' will set a fixed number of cycles. This is what you usually
                  need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
  'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
                  handle.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEUP
Number of cycles added or subtracted with speed control hotkeys.
Run INTRO and see Special Keys for list of hotkeys.

.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_MIDDLE_RELEASE
If true, middle-click will release the captured mouse, and also
capture when seamless.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_SENSITIVITY
Default mouse sensitivity. 100 is a base value, 150 is 150% sensitivity, etc.
Negative values reverse mouse direction, 0 disables the movement completely.
The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,200).
Setting can be adjusted in runtime (also per mouse interface) using internal
MOUSECTL.COM tool, available on drive Z:.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_RAW_INPUT
Enable to bypass your operating system's mouse acceleration and sensitivity
settings. Works in fullscreen or when the mouse is captured in window mode.
.
:CONFIG_DOS_MOUSE_DRIVER
Enable built-in DOS mouse driver.
Notes:
   Disable if you intend to use original MOUSE.COM driver in emulated DOS.
   When guest OS is booted, built-in driver gets disabled automatically.
.
:CONFIG_DOS_MOUSE_IMMEDIATE
Updates mouse movement counters immediately, without waiting for interrupt.
May improve gameplay, especially in fast paced games (arcade, FPS, etc.) - as
for some games it effectively boosts the mouse sampling rate to 1000 Hz, without
increasing interrupt overhead.
Might cause compatibility issues. List of known incompatible games:
   - Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss
   - Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds
Please file a bug with the project if you find another game that fails when
this is enabled, we will update this list.

  <strength>:  Set crossfeed strength from 0 to 100, where 0 means no crossfeed
               (off) and 100 full crossfeed (effectively turning stereo content
               into mono).
Note: You can set per-channel crossfeed via mixer commands.
.
:CONFIG_REVERB
Enable reverb globally to add a sense of space to the sound:
  off:     No reverb (default).
  on:      Enable reverb (medium preset).
  tiny:    Simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a room;
           specifically designed for small-speaker audio systems
           (PC Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and LPT DAC devices).
  small:   Adds a subtle sense of space; good for games that use a single
           synth channel (typically OPL) for both music and sound effects.
  medium:  Medium room preset that works well with a wide variety of games.
  large:   Large hall preset recommended for games that use separate
           channels for music and digital audio.
  huge:    A stronger variant of the large hall preset; works really well
           in some games with more atmospheric soundtracks.
Note: You can fine-tune per-channel reverb levels via mixer commands.

           synth music that features lots of white noise.)
  normal:  Normal chorus that works well with a wide variety of games.
  strong:  An obvious and upfront chorus effect.
Note: You can fine-tune per-channel chorus levels via mixer commands.
.
:CONFIG_MIDIDEVICE

interface - MPU-401). Choose one of the following:
'fluidsynth', to use the built-in MIDI synthesizer. See the
       [fluidsynth] section for detailed configuration.
'mt32', to use the built-in Roland MT-32 synthesizer.
       See the [mt32] section for detailed configuration.
'auto', to use the first working external MIDI player. This
       might be a software synthesizer or physical device.
.
:CONFIG_MIDICONFIG
Configuration options for the selected MIDI interface.
This is usually the id or name of the MIDI synthesizer you want
to use (find the id/name with DOS command 'mixer /listmidi').
- This option has no effect when using the built-in synthesizers
  (mididevice = fluidsynth or mt32).
- When using ALSA, use Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list open
  MIDI ports, and select one (for example 'midiconfig=14:0'
  for sequencer client 14, port 0).
- If you're using a physical Roland MT-32 with revision 0 PCB,
  the hardware may require a delay in order to prevent its
  buffer from overflowing. In that case, add 'delaysysex',
  for example: 'midiconfig=2 delaysysex'.
See the README/Manual for more details.
.
:CONFIG_MPU401
Type of MPU-401 to emulate.

has been deprecated. Please use a mixer command instead to
change the FluidSynth audio channel's volume, e.g.:
  MIXER FSYNTH 200
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_CHORUS
Chorus effect: 'auto', 'on', 'off', or custom values.
When using custom values:

  - voice-count is an integer from 0 to 99.
  - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 10.0
  - speed is a decimal, measured in Hz, from 0.1 to 5.0
  - depth is a decimal from 0.0 to 21.0
  - modulation-wave is either 'sine' or 'triangle'
  For example: chorus = 3 1.2 0.3 8.0 sine
Note: You can disable the FluidSynth chorus and enable the
mixer-level chorus on the FluidSynth channel instead, or
enable both chorus effects at the same time. Whether this
sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the chorus settings
being used.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_REVERB
Reverb effect: 'auto', 'on', 'off', or custom values.
When using custom values:
  All four must be provided in-order and space-separated.

  - damping is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
  - width is a decimal from 0.0 to 100.0
  - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
  For example: reverb = 0.61 0.23 0.76 0.56
Note: You can disable the FluidSynth reverb and enable the
mixer-level reverb on the FluidSynth channel instead, or
enable both reverb effects at the same time. Whether this
sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the reverb settings
being used.
.

.
:CONFIG_ROMDIR
The directory containing ROMs for one or more models.
The directory can be absolute or relative, or leave it blank to
use the 'mt32-roms' directory in your DOSBox configuration
directory. Other common system locations will be checked as well.
ROM files inside this directory may include any of the following:
  - MT32_CONTROL.ROM and MT32_PCM.ROM, for the 'mt32' model.

Enable UMB support.
.
:CONFIG_VER
Set DOS version (5.0 by default). Specify as major.minor format.
A single number is treated as the major version.
Common settings are 3.3, 5.0, 6.22, and 7.1.
.
:CONFIG_COUNTRY

:CONFIG_NE2000
Enable emulation of a Novell NE2000 network card on a software-based
network (using libslirp) with properties as follows:
 - 255.255.255.0 : Subnet mask of the 10.0.2.0 virtual LAN.
 - 10.0.2.2      : IP of the gateway and DHCP service.
 - 10.0.2.3      : IP of the virtual DNS server.
 - 10.0.2.15     : First IP provided by DHCP, your IP!
Note: Inside DOS, setting this up requires an NE2000 packet driver,
      DHCP client, and TCP/IP stack. You might need port-forwarding
      from the host into the DOS guest, and from your router to your
      host when acting as the server for multiplayer games.
.
:CONFIG_NICBASE
The base address of the NE2000 card.
Note: Addresses 220 and 240 might not be available as they're assigned
      to the Sound Blaster and Gravis UltraSound by default.
.
:CONFIG_NICIRQ
The interrupt used by the NE2000 card.
Note: IRQs 3 and 5 might not be available as they're assigned
      to 'serial2' and the Gravis UltraSound by default.
.
:CONFIG_MACADDR
The MAC address of the NE2000 card.
.
:CONFIG_TCP_PORT_FORWARDS
Forwards one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
The format is:
  port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
  This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
  host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
  This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest
A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
  start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
  This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
  hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
  This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest
Notes:
  - If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
  - If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
  - If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
.
:CONFIG_UDP_PORT_FORWARDS
Forwards one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
The format is the same as for TCP port forwards.
.

[erases=entire][color=green]How to mount a real/virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox:[reset]
DOSBox provides CD-ROM emulation on two levels.

The [color=light-yellow]basic[reset] level works on all normal directories, which installs MSCDEX
and marks the files read-only. Usually this is enough for most games:
[color=blue]mount D C:\example -t cdrom[reset]
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:
[color=blue]mount D C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[reset]

The [color=light-yellow]next[reset] level adds some low-level support.
Therefore only works on CD-ROM drives:
[color=blue]mount d[reset] [color=light-red]D:\ [color=blue]-t cdrom -usecd [color=yellow]0[reset]
Replace [color=light-red]D:\ [reset]with the location of your CD-ROM.
Replace the [color=yellow]0[reset] in [color=blue]-usecd [color=yellow]0[reset] with the number reported for your CD-ROM if you type:
[color=blue]mount -listcd[reset]

Additionally, you can use imgmount to mount iso or cue/bin images:
[color=blue]imgmount D C:\cd.iso -t cdrom[reset]
[color=blue]imgmount D C:\cd.cue -t cdrom[reset]

  and code page. It will change to [color=cyan]LANGCODE[reset] if provided, optionally with a
  [color=white]CODEPAGE[reset] and an additional CODEPAGEFILE to load the specified code page
  number and code page file if provided. This command is especially useful if
  you use a non-US keyboard, and [color=cyan]LANGCODE[reset] can also be set in the configuration
  file under the [dos] section using the "keyboardlayout = [color=cyan]LANGCODE[reset]" setting.

Examples:
  [color=green]KEYB[reset]
  [color=green]KEYB[reset] [color=cyan]uk[reset]
  [color=green]KEYB[reset] [color=cyan]sp[reset] [color=white]850[reset]

Where:
  [color=cyan]CHANNEL[reset]  is the sound channel to change the settings of.
  [color=white]COMMANDS[reset] is one or more of the following commands:
    Volume:    [color=white]0[reset] to [color=white]100[reset], or decibel value prefixed with [color=white]d[reset] (e.g. [color=white]d-7.5[reset])
               use [color=white]L:R[reset] to set the left and right side separately (e.g. [color=white]10:20[reset])
    Lineout:   [color=white]stereo[reset], [color=white]reverse[reset] (for stereo channels only)
    Crossfeed: [color=white]x0[reset] to [color=white]x100[reset]    Reverb: [color=white]r0[reset] to [color=white]r100[reset]    Chorus: [color=white]c0[reset] to [color=white]c100[reset]

Notes:
  Running [color=green]mixer[reset] without an argument shows the current mixer settings.
  You may change the settings of more than one channel in a single command.
  If channel is unspecified, you can set crossfeed, reverb or chorus globally.
  You can view the list of available MIDI devices with /listmidi.
