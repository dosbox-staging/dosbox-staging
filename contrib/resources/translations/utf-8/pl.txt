Defaults (if not present or incorrect): seamless middlerelease
.
:CONFIG_SENSITIVITY
Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
.
:CONFIG_RAW_MOUSE_INPUT
Enable this setting to bypass your operating system's mouse

There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
.
:CONFIG_MCB_FAULT_STRATEGY
How software-corrupted memory chain blocks should be handled:
  deny:    Quit (and report) when faults are detected (default).
  repair:  Repair (and report) faults using adjacent chain blocks.

Controls the selection of VESA 1.2 and 2.0 modes offered:
  compatible   A tailored selection that maximizes game compatibility.
               This is recommended along with 4 or 8 MB of video memory.
  all          Offers all modes for a given video memory size, however
               some games may not use them properly (flickering) or may need
               more system memory (mem = ) to use them.
.
:CONFIG_SPEED_MODS

ratio, matching that of the original standard-definition monitors
for which the majority of DOS games were designed. This setting
only affects video modes that use non-square pixels, such as
320x200 or 640x400; where as square-pixel modes, such as 640x480
and 800x600, will be displayed as-is.
.
:CONFIG_MONOCHROME_PALETTE
Select default palette for monochrome display.
Works only when emulating hercules or cga_mono.
You can also cycle through available colours using F11.
.
:CONFIG_SCALER
Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes.
If 'forced' is appended, then the scaler will be used even if
the result might not be desired.
Note that some scalers may use black borders to fit the image
within your configured display resolution. If this is
undesirable, try either a different scaler or enabling
fullresolution output.
.
:CONFIG_GLSHADER
Either 'none' or a GLSL shader name. Works only with
OpenGL output.  Can be either an absolute path, a file
in the 'glshaders' subdirectory of the DOSBox

:CONFIG_CYCLES
Number of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
  'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
                  It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
  'fixed #number' will set a fixed number of cycles. This is what you usually
                  need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
  'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
                  handle.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEUP

  <strength>:  Set crossfeed strength from 0 to 100, where 0 means no crossfeed (off)
               and 100 full crossfeed (effectively turning stereo content into mono).
Note: You can set per-channel crossfeed via mixer commands.
.
:CONFIG_REVERB
Enable reverb globally to add a sense of space to the sound:
  off:     No reverb (default).
  on:      Enable reverb (medium preset).
  tiny:    Simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a room;
           specifically designed for small-speaker audio systems
           (PC Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and Disney).
  small:   Adds a subtle sense of space; good for games that use a single
           synth channel (typically OPL) for both music and sound effects.
  medium:  Medium room preset that works well with a wide variety of games.
  large:   Large hall preset recommended for games that use separate
           channels for music and digital audio.
  huge:    A stronger variant of the large hall preset; works really well
           in some games with more atmospheric soundtracks.
Note: You can fine-tune per-channel reverb levels via mixer commands.

'mt32', to use the built-in Roland MT-32 synthesizer.
       See the [mt32] section for detailed configuration.
'auto', to use the first working external MIDI player. This
       might be a software synthesizer or physical device.
.
:CONFIG_MIDICONFIG
Configuration options for the selected MIDI interface.
This is usually the id or name of the MIDI synthesizer you want
to use (find the id/name with DOS command 'mixer /listmidi').
- This option has no effect when using the built-in synthesizers
  (mididevice = fluidsynth or mt32).
- When using ALSA, use Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list open
  MIDI ports, and select one (for example 'midiconfig=14:0'
  for sequencer client 14, port 0).
- If you're using a physical Roland MT-32 with revision 0 PCB,
  the hardware may require a delay in order to prevent its
  buffer from overflowing. In that case, add 'delaysysex',
  for example: 'midiconfig=2 delaysysex'.
See the README/Manual for more details.

  - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 10.0
  - speed is a decimal, measured in Hz, from 0.1 to 5.0
  - depth is a decimal from 0.0 to 21.0
  - modulation-wave is either 'sine' or 'triangle'
  For example: chorus = 3 1.2 0.3 8.0 sine

.
:CONFIG_TCP_PORT_FORWARDS
Forwards one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
The format is:
  port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
  This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
  host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
  This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest
A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
  start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
  This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
  hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
  This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest
Uwagi:
  - If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
  - If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
  - If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
.
:CONFIG_UDP_PORT_FORWARDS
Forwards one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
