Usage: %s [OPTION]... [PATH]

PATH                       If PATH is a directory, it's mounted as C:.

:CONFIGITEM_OUTPUT_OPENGL_DEFAULT
Rendering backend to use for graphics output ('opengl' by default).
Only the 'opengl' backend has shader support and is thus the preferred option.
The 'texture' backend is only provided as a last resort fallback for buggy or
non-existent OpenGL drivers (this is extremely rare).
.
:CONFIGITEM_OUTPUT_TEXTURE_DEFAULT
Rendering backend to use for graphics output ('texture' by default).
.
:CONFIGITEM_OUTPUT_OPENGL
  opengl:     OpenGL backend with shader support (default).
.
:CONFIGITEM_OUTPUT_TEXTURE
  texture:    SDL's texture backend with bilinear interpolation.
.
:CONFIGITEM_OUTPUT_TEXTURENB
  texturenb:  SDL's texture backend with nearest-neighbour interpolation
              (no bilinear).
.
:CONFIG_TEXTURE_RENDERER
Render driver to use in 'texture' output mode ('auto' by default).
Use 'texture_renderer = auto' for an automatic choice.
.
:CONFIG_DISPLAY
Number of display to use; values depend on OS and user settings (0 by default).
.
:CONFIG_FULLSCREEN
Start directly in fullscreen ('off' by default).
Run INTRO and see Special Keys for window control hotkeys.
.
:CONFIG_FULLRESOLUTION
What resolution to use for fullscreen: 'original', 'desktop'
or a fixed size, e.g. 1024x768 ('desktop' by default).
.
:CONFIG_WINDOWRESOLUTION
Set intial window size for windowed mode. You can still resize the window
after startup.
  default:   Select the best option based on your environment and other
             settings (such as whether aspect ratio correction is enabled).
  small, medium, large (s, m, l):
             Size the window relative to the desktop.
  WxH:       Specify window size in WxH format in logical units
             (e.g., 1024x768).
.
:CONFIG_WINDOW_POSITION
Set initial window position for windowed mode:
  auto:      Let the window manager decide the position (default).
  X,Y:       Set window position in X,Y format (e.g., 250,100).
             0,0 is the top-left corner of the screen.
.
:CONFIG_WINDOW_DECORATIONS
Enable window decorations in windowed mode ('on' by default).
.
:CONFIG_WINDOW_TITLEBAR
Space separated list of information to be displayed in the window's titlebar
('program=name dosbox=auto cycles=on mouse=full' by default). If a parameter
is not specified, its default value is used.
Possible information to display are:
  animation=<value>:  If set to 'on' (default), animate the audio/video
                      recording mark. Set to 'off' to disable animation; this
                      is useful if your screen font produces weird results.
  program=<value>:    Display the name of the running program.
                      <value> can be one of:
                        none/off:  Do not display program name.
                        name:      Program name, with file extension (default).
                        path:      Name, extension, and full absolute path.
                        segment:   Display program memory segment name.
                        'Title':   Custom name. Alternatively, you can use
                                   "Title", (Title), <Title> or [Title] form.
                      Note: With some software (like Windows 3.1x in enhanced
                      mode) it is impossible to recognize the full program
                      name or path; in such cases 'segment' is used instead.
  dosbox=<value>:     Display 'DOSBox Staging' in the title bar.
                      <value> can be one of:
                        always:   Always display 'DOSBox Staging'.
                        auto:     Only display it if no program is running or
                                  'program=none' is set (default).
  version=<value>:    Display DOSBox version information.
                      <value> can be one of:
                         none/off:  Do not display DOSBox version (default).
                         simple:    Simple version information.
                         detailed:  Include Git hash, if available.
  cycles=<value>:     If set to 'on' (default), show CPU cycles setting.
                      Set to 'off' to disable cycles setting display.
  mouse=<value>:      Mouse capturing hint verbosity level:
                        none/off:  Do not display any mouse hints.
                        short:     Only display if mouse is captured.
                        full:      Display verbose information on how to
                                   capture or release the cursor (default).
.
:CONFIG_TRANSPARENCY
Set the transparency of the DOSBox Staging screen (0 by default).
From 0 (no transparency) to 90 (high transparency).
.
:CONFIG_MAX_RESOLUTION
Moved to [render] section and renamed to 'viewport'.
.
:CONFIG_VIEWPORT_RESOLUTION
Moved to [render] section and renamed to 'viewport'.
.
:CONFIG_HOST_RATE
Set the host's refresh rate:
  auto:      Use SDI rates, or VRR rates when in fullscreen on a high-refresh
             rate display (default).
  sdi:       Use serial device interface (SDI) rates, without further
             adjustment.
  vrr:       Deduct 3 Hz from the reported rate (best practice for VRR
             displays).
  N:         Specify custom refresh rate in Hz (decimal values are allowed;
             23.000 is the allowed minimum).
.
:CONFIG_VSYNC
Set the host video driver's vertical synchronization (vsync) mode:
  auto:      Limit vsync to beneficial cases, such as when using an
             interpolating VRR display in fullscreen (default).
  on:        Enable vsync. This can prevent tearing in some games but will
             impact performance or drop frames when the DOS rate exceeds the
             host rate (e.g. 70 Hz DOS rate vs 60 Hz host rate).
  adaptive:  Enables vsync when the frame rate is higher than the host rate,
             but disables it when the frame rate drops below the host rate.
             This is a reasonable alternative on macOS instead of 'on'.
             Note: only valid in OpenGL output modes; otherwise treated as
             'on'.
  off:       Attempt to disable vsync to allow quicker frame presentation at
             the risk of tearing in some games.
  yield:     Let the host's video driver control video synchronization.
.
:CONFIG_VSYNC_SKIP
Number of microseconds to allow rendering to block before skipping the
next frame. For example, a value of 7000 is roughly half the frame time
at 70 Hz. 0 disables this and will always render (default).
.
:CONFIG_PRESENTATION_MODE
Select the frame presentation mode:
  auto:  Intelligently time and drop frames to prevent emulation stalls,
         based on host and DOS frame rates (default).
  cfr:   Always present DOS frames at a constant frame rate.
  vfr:   Always present changed DOS frames at a variable frame rate.
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURE_MOUSE
Moved to [mouse] section and renamed to 'mouse_capture'.
.
:CONFIG_SENSITIVITY
Moved to [mouse] section and renamed to 'mouse_sensitivity'.
.
:CONFIG_RAW_MOUSE_INPUT
Moved to [mouse] section and renamed to 'mouse_raw_input'.
.
:CONFIG_WAITONERROR
Keep the console open if an error has occurred ('on' by default).
.
:CONFIG_PRIORITY
Priority levels to apply when active and inactive, respectively.
('auto auto' by default)
'auto' lets the host operating system manage the priority.
.
:CONFIG_MUTE_WHEN_INACTIVE
Mute the sound when the window is inactive ('off' by default).
.
:CONFIG_PAUSE_WHEN_INACTIVE
Pause emulation when the window is inactive ('off' by default).
.
:CONFIG_MAPPERFILE
Path to the mapper file ('mapper-sdl2-XYZ.map' by default, where XYZ is the
current version). Pre-configured maps are bundled in 'resources/mapperfiles'.
These can be loaded by name, e.g., with 'mapperfile = xbox/xenon2.map'.
Note: The '--resetmapper' command line option only deletes the default mapper
      file.
.
:CONFIG_SCREENSAVER
Use 'allow' or 'block' to override the SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER environment
variable which usually blocks the OS screensaver while the emulator is
running ('auto' by default).
.
:CONFIG_LANGUAGE
Select the DOS messages language:
  auto:     Detects the language from the host OS (default).
  <value>:  Loads a translation from the given file.
Notes:
  - The following language files are available:
    'br', 'de', 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'it', 'nl', 'pl' and 'ru'.
  - English is built-in, the rest is stored in the bundled
    'resources/translations' directory.
.
:CONFIG_MACHINE
Set the video adapter or machine to emulate:
  hercules:       Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) (see 'monochrome_palette').
  cga_mono:       CGA adapter connected to a monochrome monitor (see
                  'monochrome_palette').
  cga:            IBM Color Graphics Adapter (CGA). Also enables composite
                  video emulation (see [composite] section).
  pcjr:           An IBM PCjr machine. Also enables PCjr sound and composite
                  video emulation (see [composite] section).
  tandy:          A Tandy 1000 machine with TGA graphics. Also enables Tandy
                  sound and composite video emulation (see [composite]
                  section).
  ega:            IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA).
  svga_paradise:  Paradise PVGA1A SVGA card (no VESA VBE; 512K vmem by default,
                  can be set to 256K or 1MB with 'vmemsize'). This is the
                  closest to IBM's original VGA adapter.
  svga_et3000:    Tseng Labs ET3000 SVGA card (no VESA VBE; fixed 512K vmem).
  svga_et4000:    Tseng Labs ET4000 SVGA card (no VESA VBE; 1MB vmem by
                  default, can be set to 256K or 512K with 'vmemsize').
  svga_s3:        S3 Trio64 (VESA VBE 2.0; 4MB vmem by default, can be set to
                  512K, 1MB, 2MB, or 8MB with 'vmemsize') (default)
  vesa_oldvbe:    Same as 'svga_s3' but limited to VESA VBE 1.2.
  vesa_nolfb:     Same as 'svga_s3' (VESA VBE 2.0), plus the "no linear
                  framebuffer" hack (needed only by a few games).
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURES
Moved to [capture] section and renamed to 'capture_dir'.
.
:CONFIG_MEMSIZE
Amount of memory of the emulated machine has in MB (16 by default).
Best leave at the default setting to avoid problems with some games,
though a few games might require a higher value.
There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
.
:CONFIG_MCB_FAULT_STRATEGY
How software-corrupted memory chain blocks should be handled:
  repair:  Repair (and report) faults using adjacent blocks (default).
  report:  Report faults but otherwise proceed as-is.
  allow:   Allow faults to go unreported (hardware behavior).
  deny:    Quit (and report) when faults are detected.
.
:CONFIG_VMEMSIZE
Video memory in MB (1-8) or KB (256 to 8192). 'auto' uses the default for
the selected video adapter ('auto' by default). See the 'machine' setting for
the list of valid options and defaults per adapter.
.
:CONFIG_VMEM_DELAY
Set video memory access delay emulation ('off' by default).
  off:      Disable video memory access delay emulation (default).
            This is preferable for most games to avoid slowdowns.
  on:       Enable video memory access delay emulation (3000 ns).
            This can help reduce or eliminate flicker in Hercules,
            CGA, EGA, and early VGA games.
  <value>:  Set access delay in nanoseconds. Valid range is 0 to 20000 ns;
            500 to 5000 ns is the most useful range.
Note: Only set this on a per-game basis when necessary as it slows down
      the whole emulator.
.
:CONFIG_DOS_RATE
Customize the emulated video mode's frame rate.
  default:  The DOS video mode determines the rate (default).
  host:     Match the DOS rate to the host rate (see 'host_rate' setting).
  <value>:  Sets the rate to an exact value in between 24.000 and 1000.000 Hz.
Note: We recommend the 'default' rate, otherwise test and set on a per-game
      basis.
.
:CONFIG_VESA_MODES
Controls which VESA video modes are available:
  compatible:  Only the most compatible VESA modes for the configured video
               memory size (default). Recommended with 4 or 8 MB of video
               memory ('vmemsize') for the widest compatiblity with games.
               320x200 high colour modes are excluded as they were not
               properly supported until the late '90s. The 256-colour linear
               framebuffer 320x240, 400x300, and 512x384 modes are also
               excluded as they cause timing problems in Build Engine games.
  halfline:    Same as 'compatible', but the 120h VESA mode is replaced with
               a special halfline mode used by Extreme Assault. Use only if
               needed.
  all:         All modes are available, including extra DOSBox-specific VESA
               modes. Use 8 MB of video memory for the best results. Some
               games misbehave in the presence of certain VESA modes; try
               'compatible' mode if this happens. The 320x200 high colour
               modes available in this mode are often required by late '90s
               demoscene productions.
.
:CONFIG_VGA_8DOT_FONT
Use 8-pixel-wide fonts on VGA adapters ('off' by default).
.
:CONFIG_VGA_RENDER_PER_SCANLINE
Emulate accurate per-scanline VGA rendering ('on' by default).
Currently, you need to disable this for a few games, otherwise they will crash
at startup (e.g., Deus, Ishar 3, Robinson's Requiem, Time Warriors).
.
:CONFIG_SPEED_MODS
Permit changes known to improve performance ('on' by default).
Currently, no games are known to be negatively affected by this.
Please file a bug with the project if you find a game that fails
when this is enabled so we will list them here.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOEXEC_SECTION
How autoexec sections are handled from multiple config files:
  join:       Combine them into one big section (legacy behavior; default).
  overwrite:  Use the last one encountered, like other config settings.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOMOUNT
Mount 'drives/[c]' directories as drives on startup, where [c] is a lower-case
drive letter from 'a' to 'y' ('on' by default). The 'drives' folder can be
provided relative to the current directory or via built-in resources.
Mount settings can be optionally provided using a [c].conf file along-side
the drive's directory, with content as follows:
  [drive]
  type     = dir, overlay, floppy, or cdrom
  label    = custom_label
  path     = path-specification (e.g., path = %%path%%;c:\tools)
  override_drive = mount the directory to this drive instead (default empty)
  verbose  = on or off
  readonly = on or off
.
:CONFIG_STARTUP_VERBOSITY
Controls verbosity prior to displaying the program ('auto' by default):
  Verbosity   | Welcome | Early stdout
  high        |   yes   |    yes
  low         |   no    |    yes
  quiet       |   no    |    no
  auto        | 'low' if exec or dir is passed, otherwise 'high'
.
:CONFIG_ALLOW_WRITE_PROTECTED_FILES
Many games open all their files with writable permissions; even files that they
never modify. This setting lets you write-protect those files while still
allowing the game to read them ('on' by default). A second use-case: if you're
using a copy-on-write or network-based filesystem, this setting avoids
triggering write operations for these write-protected files.
.
:CONFIG_SHELL_CONFIG_SHORTCUTS
Allow shortcuts for simpler configuration management ('on' by default).
E.g., instead of 'config -set sbtype sb16', it is enough to execute
'sbtype sb16', and instead of 'config -get sbtype', you can just execute
the 'sbtype' command.
.
:CONFIG_FRAMESKIP
Consider capping frame rates using the 'host_rate' setting.
.
:CONFIGITEM_GLSHADER
Set an adaptive CRT monitor emulation shader or a regular GLSL shader in OpenGL
output modes ('crt-auto' by default). Adaptive CRT shader options:
  crt-auto:               A CRT shader that prioritises developer intent and
                          how people experienced the game at the time of
                          release (default). The appropriate shader variant is
                          automatically selected based the graphics standard of
                          the current video mode and the viewport size,
                          irrespective of the 'machine' setting. This means
                          that even on an emulated VGA card you'll get
                          authentic single-scanned EGA monitor emulation with
                          visible "thick scanlines" in EGA games.
  crt-auto-machine:       Similar to 'crt-auto', but this picks a fixed CRT
                          monitor appropriate for the video adapter configured
                          via the 'machine' setting. E.g., CGA and EGA games
                          will appear double-scanned on an emulated VGA
                          adapter.
  crt-auto-arcade:        Emulation of an arcade or home computer monitor less
                          sharp than a typical PC monitor with thick scanlines
                          in low-resolution modes. This fantasy option does not
                          exist in real life, but it can be a lot of fun,
                          especially with DOS ports of Amiga games.
  crt-auto-arcade-sharp:  A sharper variant of the arcade shader for those who
                          like the thick scanlines but want to retain the
                          horizontal sharpness of a typical PC monitor.

Other shader options include (non-exhaustive list):
  sharp:                  Upscale the image treating the pixels as rectangles.
                          Results in a sharp image with minimum blur.
  bilinear:               Upscale the image using bilinear interpolation
                          (results in a blurry image).
  nearest:                Upscale the image using nearest-neighbour
                          interpolation (also known as "no bilinear"). Results
                          in the sharpest possible image at the expense of
                          uneven pixels (this is less of an issue on high
                          resolution screens).

Start DOSBox Staging with the '--list-glshaders' command line option to see the
full list of available shaders. You can also use an absolute or relative path to
a file. In all cases, you may omit the shader's '.glsl' file extension.
.
:CONFIG_ASPECT
Set the aspect ratio correction mode ('auto' by default):
  auto, on:            Apply aspect ratio correction for modern square-pixel
                       flat-screen displays, so DOS video modes with non-square
                       pixels appear as they would on a 4:3 display aspect
                       ratio CRT monitor the majority of DOS games were
                       designed for. This setting only affects video modes that
                       use non-square pixels, such as 320x200 or 640x400;.
                       square-pixelmodes (e.g., 320x240, 640x480, and 800x600),
                       are displayed as-is.
  square-pixels, off:  Don't apply aspect ratio correction; all DOS video modes
                       are displayed with square pixels. Most 320x200 games
                       will appear squashed, but a minority of titles (e.g.,
                       DOS ports of PAL Amiga games) need square pixels to
                       appear as the artists intended.
  stretch:             Calculate the aspect ratio from the viewport's
                       dimensions. Combined with 'viewport', this mode is
                       useful to force arbitrary aspect ratios (e.g.,
                       stretching DOS games to fullscreen on 16:9 displays) and
                       to emulate the horizontal and vertical stretch controls
                       of CRT monitors.
.
:CONFIG_INTEGER_SCALING
Constrain the horizontal or vertical scaling factor to the largest integer
value so the image still fits into the viewport ('auto' by default). The
configured aspect ratio is always maintained according to the 'aspect' and
'viewport' settings, which may result in a non-integer scaling factor in the
other dimension. If the image is larger than the viewport, the integer scaling
constraint is auto-disabled (same as 'off'). Possible values:
  auto:        'vertical' mode auto-enabled for adaptive CRT shaders only
               (see 'glshader'), otherwise 'off' (default).
  vertical:    Constrain the vertical scaling factor to integer values.
               This is the recommended setting for CRT shaders to avoid uneven
               scanlines and interference artifacts.
  horizontal:  Constrain the horizontal scaling factor to integer values.
  off:         No integer scaling constraint is applied; the image fills the
               viewport while maintaining the configured aspect ratio.
.
:CONFIG_VIEWPORT
Set the viewport size ('fit' by default). This is the maximum drawable area;
the video output is always contained within the viewport while taking the
configured aspect ratio into account (see 'aspect'). Possible values:
  fit:             Fit the viewport into the available window/screen (default).
                   There might be padding (black areas) around the image with
                   'integer_scaling' enabled.
  WxH:             Set a fixed viewport size in WxH format in logical units
                   (e.g., 960x720). The specified size must not be larger than
                   the desktop. If it's larger than the window size, it's
                   scaled to fit within the window.
  N%%:              Similar to 'WxH' but the size is specified as a percentage
                   of the desktop size.
  relative H%% V%%:  The viewport is set to a 4:3 aspect ratio rectangle fit into
                   the available window/screen, then it's scaled by the H and V
                   horizontal and vertical scaling factors (valid range is from
                   20%% to 300%%). The resulting viewport is allowed to extend
                   beyond the window/screen. Useful to force arbitrary display
                   aspect ratios with 'aspect = stretch' and to zoom into the
                   image. This effectively emulates the horizontal and vertical
                   stretch controls of CRT monitors.
Notes:
  - Using 'relative' mode with 'integer_scaling' enabled could lead to
    surprising (but correct) results.
  - You can use the 'Stretch Axis', 'Inc Stretch', and 'Dec Stretch' hotkey
    actions to set the stretch in 'relative' mode in real-time.
.
:CONFIG_MONOCHROME_PALETTE
Set the palette for monochrome display emulation ('amber' by default).
Works only with the 'hercules' and 'cga_mono' machine types.
Note: You can also cycle through the available palettes via hotkeys.
.
:CONFIG_CGA_COLORS
Set the interpretation of CGA RGBI colours ('default' by default). Affects all
machine types capable of displaying CGA or better graphics. Built-in presets:
  default:       The canonical CGA palette, as emulated by VGA adapters
                 (default).
  tandy <bl>:    Emulation of an idealised Tandy monitor with adjustable brown
                 level. The brown level can be provided as an optional second
                 parameter (0 - red, 50 - brown, 100 - dark yellow;
                 defaults to 50). E.g. tandy 100
  tandy-warm:    Emulation of the actual colour output of an unknown Tandy
                 monitor.
  ibm5153 <c>:   Emulation of the actual colour output of an IBM 5153 monitor
                 with a unique contrast control that dims non-bright colours
                 only. The contrast can be optionally provided as a second
                 parameter (0 to 100; defaults to 100), e.g. ibm5153 60
  agi-amiga-v1, agi-amiga-v2, agi-amiga-v3:
                 Palettes used by the Amiga ports of Sierra AGI games.
  agi-amigaish:  A mix of EGA and Amiga colours used by the Sarien
                 AGI-interpreter.
  scumm-amiga:   Palette used by the Amiga ports of LucasArts EGA games.
  colodore:      Commodore 64 inspired colours based on the Colodore palette.
  colodore-sat:  Colodore palette with 20%% more saturation.
  dga16:         A modern take on the canonical CGA palette with dialed back
                 contrast.
You can also set custom colours by specifying 16 space or comma separated
colour values, either as 3 or 6-digit hex codes (e.g. #f00 or #ff0000 for full
red), or decimal RGB triplets (e.g. (255, 0, 255) for magenta). The 16 colours
are ordered as follows:
  black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, light-grey, dark-grey,
  light-blue, light-green, light-cyan, light-red, light-magenta, yellow, white.
Their default values, shown here in 6-digit hex code format, are:
  #000000 #0000aa #00aa00 #00aaaa #aa0000 #aa00aa #aa5500 #aaaaaa
  #555555 #5555ff #55ff55 #55ffff #ff5555 #ff55ff #ffff55 #ffffff
.
:CONFIG_SCALER
Software scalers are deprecated in favour of hardware-accelerated options:
  - If you used the normal2x/3x scalers, set the desired 'windowresolution'
    or 'viewport' instead, or consider using 'integer_scaling'.
  - If you used an advanced scaler, consider one of the 'glshader'
    options instead.
.
:CONFIG_COMPOSITE
Enable composite mode on start (only for 'cga', 'pcjr', and 'tandy' machine
types; 'auto' by default). 'auto' lets the program decide.
Note: Fine-tune the settings below (i.e., 'hue') using the composite hotkeys,
      then copy the new settings from the logs into your config.
.
:CONFIG_ERA
Era of composite technology ('auto' by default).
When 'auto', PCjr uses 'new', and CGA/Tandy use 'old'.
.
:CONFIG_HUE
Hue of the RGB palette (0 by default).
For example, adjust until the sky is blue.
.
:CONFIG_SATURATION
Intensity of colors, from washed out to vivid (100 by default).
.
:CONFIG_CONTRAST
Ratio between the dark and light area (100 by default).
.
:CONFIG_BRIGHTNESS
Luminosity of the image, from dark to light (0 by default).
.
:CONFIG_CONVERGENCE
Convergence of subpixel elements, from blurry to sharp (0 by default).
.
:CONFIG_CORE
Type of CPU emulation core to use ('auto' by default).
  auto:     'normal' core for real mode programs, 'dynamic' core for protected
            mode programs (default). Most programs will run correctly with this
            setting.
  normal:   The DOS program is interpreted instruction by instruction. This
            yields the most accurate timings, but puts 3-5 times more load on
            the host CPU compared to the 'dynamic' core. Therefore, it's
            generally only recommended for real mode programs that don't need
            a fast emulated CPU or are timing-sensitive. The 'normal' core is
            also necessary for programs that self-modify their code.
  simple:   The 'normal' core optimised for old real mode programs; it might
            give you slightly better compatibility with older games. Auto-
            switches to the 'normal' core in protected mode.
  dynamic:  The instructions of the DOS program are translated to host CPU
            instructions in blocks and are then executed directly. This puts
            3-5 times less load on the host CPU compared to the 'normal' core,
            but the timings might be less accurate. The 'dynamic' core is a
            necessity for demanding DOS programs (e.g., 3D SVGA games).
            Programs that self-modify their code might misbehave or crash on
            the 'dynamic' core; use the 'normal' core for such programs.
.
:CONFIG_CPUTYPE
CPU type to emulate ('auto' by default).
You should only change this if the program doesn't run correctly on 'auto'.
  auto:          The fastest and most compatible setting (default).
                 Technically, this is '386_fast' plus 486 CPUID, 486 CR
                 register behaviour, and extra 486 instructions.
  386:           386 CPUID and 386 specific page access level calculation.
  386_fast:      Same as '386' but with loose page privilege checks which is
                 much faster.
  386_prefetch:  Same as '386_fast' plus accurate CPU prefetch queue emulation.
                 Requires 'core = normal'. This setting is necessary for
                 programs that self-modify their code or employ anti-debugging
                 tricks. Games that require '386_prefetch' include Contra, FIFA
                 International Soccer (1994), Terminator 1, and X-Men: Madness
                 in The Murderworld.
  486:           486 CPUID, 486+ specific page access level calculation, 486 CR
                 register behaviour, and extra 486 instructions.
  pentium:       Same as '486' but with Pentium CPUID, Pentium CR register
                 behaviour, and RDTSC instruction support. Recommended for
                 Windows 3.x games (e.g., Betrayal in Antara).
  pentium_mmx:   Same as 'pentium' plus MMX instruction set support. Very few
                 games use MMX instructions; it's mostly only useful for
                 demoscene productions.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLES
The 'cycles' setting is deprecated but still accepted; please use the
'cpu_cycles', 'cpu_cycles_protected' and 'cpu_throttle' settings instead as
support will be removed in the future.
.
:CONFIG_CPU_CYCLES
Speed of the emulated CPU ('3000' by default). If 'cpu_cycles_protected' is on
'auto', this sets the cycles for both real and protected mode programs.
  <number>:  Emulate a fixed number of cycles per millisecond (roughly
             equivalent to MIPS). Valid range is from 50 to 2000000.
  max:       Emulate as many cycles as your host CPU can handle on a single
             core. The number of cycles per millisecond can vary; this might
             cause issues in some DOS programs.
Notes:
  - Setting the CPU speed to 'max' or to high fixed values may result in sound
    drop-outs and general lagginess.
  - Set the lowest fixed cycles value that runs the game at an acceptable speed
    for the best results.
  - Ballpark cycles values for common CPUs. DOSBox does not do cycle-accurate
    CPU emulation, so treat these as starting points, then fine-tune per game.

.
:CONFIG_CPU_CYCLES_PROTECTED
Speed of the emulated CPU for protected mode programs only
('60000' by default).
  auto:      Use the `cpu_cycles' setting.
  <number>:  Emulate a fixed number of cycles per millisecond (roughly
             equivalent to MIPS). Valid range is from 50 to 2000000.
  max:       Emulate as many cycles as your host CPU can handle on a single
             core. The number of cycles per millisecond can vary; this might
             cause issues in some DOS programs.
Note: See 'cpu_cycles' setting for further info.
.
:CONFIG_CPU_THROTTLE
Throttle down the number of emulated CPU cycles dynamically if your host CPU
cannot keep up ('off' by default).
Only affects fixed cycles settings. When enabled, the number of cycles per
millisecond can vary; this might cause issues in some DOS programs.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEUP
Number of cycles to add with the 'Inc Cycles' hotkey (10 by default).
Values lower than 100 are treated as a percentage increase.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEDOWN
Number of cycles to subtract with the 'Dec Cycles' hotkey (20 by default).
Values lower than 100 are treated as a percentage decrease.
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO
Enable 3dfx Voodoo emulation ('on' by default). This is authentic low-level
emulation of the Voodoo card without any OpenGL passthrough, so it requires a
powerful CPU. Most games need the DOS Glide driver called 'GLIDE2X.OVL' to be
in the path for 3dfx mode to work. Many games include their own Glide driver
variants, but for some you need to provide a suitable 'GLIDE2X.OVL' version.
A small number of games integrate the Glide driver into their code, so they
don't need 'GLIDE2X.OVL'.
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO_MEMSIZE
Set the amount of video memory for 3dfx Voodoo graphics. The memory is used by
the Frame Buffer Interface (FBI) and Texture Mapping Unit (TMU) as follows:
   4: 2 MB for the FBI and one TMU with 2 MB (default).
  12: 4 MB for the FBI and two TMUs, each with 4 MB.
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO_MULTITHREADING
Renamed to 'voodoo_threads'
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO_THREADS
Use threads to improve 3dfx Voodoo performance:
  auto:     Use up to 16 threads based on available CPU cores (default).
  <value>:  Set a specific number of threads between 1 and 128.
Note: Setting this to a higher value than the number of logical CPUs your
      hardware supports is very likely to harm performance. This has been
      measured to scale well up to 8-16 threads, but it has not been tested
      on a many-core CPU. If you have a Threadripper or similar CPU, please
      let us know how it goes.
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO_BILINEAR_FILTERING
Use bilinear filtering to emulate the 3dfx Voodoo's texture smoothing effect
('on' by default). Bilinear filtering can impact frame rates on slower systems;
try turning it off if you're not getting adequate performance.
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURE_DIR
Directory where the various captures are saved, such as audio, video, MIDI
and screenshot captures. ('capture' in the current working directory by
default).
.
:CONFIG_DEFAULT_IMAGE_CAPTURE_FORMATS
Set the capture format of the default screenshot action ('upscaled' by
default):
  upscaled:  The image is bilinear-sharp upscaled and the correct aspect
             ratio is maintained, depending on the 'aspect' setting. The
             vertical scaling factor is always an integer. For example,
             320x200 content is upscaled to 1600x1200 (5:6 integer scaling),
             640x480 to 1920x1440 (3:3 integer scaling), and 640x350 to
             1400x1050 (2.1875:3 scaling; fractional horizontally and
             integer vertically). The filenames of upscaled screenshots
             have no postfix (e.g. 'image0001.png').
  rendered:  The post-rendered, post-shader image shown on the screen is
             captured. The filenames of rendered screenshots end with
             '-rendered' (e.g. 'image0001-rendered.png').
  raw:       The contents of the raw framebuffer is captured (this always
             results in square pixels). The filenames of raw screenshots
             end with '-raw' (e.g. 'image0001-raw.png').
If multiple formats are specified separated by spaces, the default
screenshot action will save multiple images in the specified formats.
Keybindings for taking single screenshots in specific formats are also
available.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_CAPTURE
Set the mouse capture behaviour:
  onclick:   Capture the mouse when clicking any mouse button in the window
             (default).
  onstart:   Capture the mouse immediately on start. Might not work correctly
             on some host operating systems.
  seamless:  Let the mouse move seamlessly between the DOSBox window and the
             rest of the desktop; captures only with middle-click or hotkey.
             Seamless mouse does not work correctly with all the games.
             Windows 3.1x can be made compatible with a custom mouse driver.
  nomouse:   Hide the mouse and don't send mouse input to the game.
For touch-screen control, use 'seamless'.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_MIDDLE_RELEASE
Release the captured mouse by middle-clicking, and also capture it in
seamless mode ('on' by default).
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_MULTI_DISPLAY_AWARE
Allow seamless mouse behavior and mouse pointer release to work in fullscreen
mode on systems with more than one display ('on' by default).
Note: You should disable this if it incorrectly detects multiple displays
      when only one should actually be used. This might happen if you are
      using mirrored display mode or using an AV receiver's HDMI input for
      audio-only listening.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_SENSITIVITY
Global mouse sensitivity for the horizontal and vertical axes, as a percentage
(100 by default). Values can be separated by spaces, commas, or semicolons
(i.e. 100,150). Negative values invert the axis, zero disables it.
Providing only one value sets sensitivity for both axes.
Sensitivity can be further fine-tuned per mouse interface using the internal
MOUSECTL.COM tool available on the Z drive.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_RAW_INPUT
Enable to bypass your operating system's mouse acceleration and sensitivity
settings ('on' by default). Works in fullscreen or when the mouse is captured
in windowed mode.
.
:CONFIG_BUILTIN_DOS_MOUSE_DRIVER
Enable the built-in DOS mouse driver ('on' by default). This results in the
lowest possible latency and the smoothest mouse movement, so only disable it
and load a real DOS mouse driver if it's really necessary (e.g., if a game is
not compatible with the built-in driver).
  on:   Enable the built-in mouse driver. `ps2_mouse_model` and
        `com_mouse_model` have no effect on the built-in driver.
  off:  Disable the built-in mouse driver (if you don't want mouse support or
        you want to load a real DOS mouse driver). To use a real DOS driver
        (e.g., MOUSE.COM or CTMOUSE.EXE), configure the mouse type with
        `ps2_mouse_model` or `com_mouse_model`, then load the driver.
        A real DOS driver might increase compatibility with some programs,
        but will introduce more input latency.
Note: The built-in driver is auto-disabled if you boot into real MS-DOS or
      Windows 9x under DOSBox. Under Windows 3.x, the driver is not disabled,
      but the Windows 3.x mouse driver takes over.
.
:CONFIG_DOS_MOUSE_DRIVER
Renamed to 'builtin_dos_mouse_driver'.
.
:CONFIG_BUILTIN_DOS_MOUSE_DRIVER_MODEL
Set the mouse model to be simulated by the built-in DOS mouse driver ('2button'
by default).
  2button:  2 buttons, the safest option for most games. The majority of DOS
            games onoly support 2 buttons, some might misbehave if the middle
            button is pressed.
  3button:  3 buttons, only supported by very few DOS games. Only use this if
            the game is known to support a 3-button mouse.
  wheel:    3 buttons + wheel, supports the CuteMouse WheelAPI version 1.0.
            No DOS game uses the mouse wheel, only a handful of DOS applications
            and Windows 3.x with special third-party drivers.
.
:CONFIG_BUILTIN_DOS_MOUSE_DRIVER_OPTIONS
Additional built-in DOS mouse driver settings as a list of space or comma
separated options (unset by default).
  immediate:  Update mouse movement counters immediately, without waiting for
              interrupt. May improve mouse latency in fast-paced games (arcade,
              FPS, etc.), but might cause issues in some titles.
              List of known incompatible games:
                - Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss
                - Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds
              Please report other incompatible games so we can update this list.
  modern:     If provided, v7.0+ Microsoft mouse driver behaviour is emulated,
              otherwise the v6.0 and earlier behaviour (the two are slightly
              incompatible). Only Descent II with the official Voodoo patch has
              been found to require the v7.0+ behaviour so far.

.
:CONFIG_DOS_MOUSE_IMMEDIATE
Configure using 'builtin_dos_mouse_driver_options'.
.
:CONFIG_PS2_MOUSE_MODEL
Set the PS/2 AUX port mouse model, or in other words, the type of the virtual
mouse plugged into the emulated PS/2 mouse port ('explorer' by default).
The setting has no effect on the built-in mouse driver (see 'dos_mouse_driver').
  standard:      3 buttons, standard PS/2 mouse.
  intellimouse:  3 buttons + wheel, Microsoft IntelliMouse.
  explorer:      5 buttons + wheel, Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer (default).
  none:          no PS/2 mouse.
.
:CONFIG_COM_MOUSE_MODEL
Set the default COM (serial) mouse model, or in other words, the type of the
virtual mouse plugged into the emulated COM ports ('wheel+msm' by default).
The setting has no effect on the built-in mouse driver (see 'dos_mouse_driver').
  2button:      2 buttons, Microsoft mouse.
  3button:      3 buttons, Logitech mouse;
                mostly compatible with Microsoft mouse.
  wheel:        3 buttons + wheel;
                mostly compatible with Microsoft mouse.
  msm:          3 buttons, Mouse Systems mouse;
                NOT compatible with Microsoft mouse.
  2button+msm:  Automatic choice between '2button' and 'msm'.
  3button+msm:  Automatic choice between '3button' and 'msm'.
  wheel+msm:    Automatic choice between 'wheel' and 'msm' (default).
Note: Enable COM port mice in the [serial] section.
.
:CONFIG_VMWARE_MOUSE
VMware mouse interface ('on' by default).
with experimental 3rd party Windows 3.1x driver.
Note: Requires PS/2 mouse to be enabled.
.
:CONFIG_VIRTUALBOX_MOUSE
VirtualBox mouse interface ('on' by default).
Fully compatible only with 3rd party Windows 3.1x driver.
Note: Requires PS/2 mouse to be enabled.
.
:CONFIG_NOSOUND
Enable silent mode ('off' by default).
Sound is still emulated in silent mode, but DOSBox outputs no sound to the host.
Capturing the emulated audio output to a WAV file works in silent mode.
.
:CONFIG_RATE
Sample rate of DOSBox's internal audio mixer in Hz (%s by default).
Valid range is 8000 to 96000 Hz. The vast majority of consumer-grade audio
hardware uses a native rate of 48000 Hz. Recommend leaving this as-is unless
you have good reason to change it. The OS will most likely resample non-standard
sample rates to 48000 Hz anyway.
.
:CONFIG_BLOCKSIZE
Block size of the host audio device in sample frames (%s by default).
Valid range is 64 to 8192. Should be set to power-of-two values (e.g., 256,
512, 1024, etc.) Larger values might help with sound stuttering but will
introduce more latency. Also see 'negotiate'.
.
:CONFIG_PREBUFFER
How many milliseconds of sound to render in advance on top of 'blocksize'
(%s by default). Larger values might help with sound stuttering but will
introduce more latency.
.
:CONFIG_NEGOTIATE
Negotiate a possibly better 'blocksize' setting (%s by default).
Enable it if you're not getting audio or the sound is stuttering with your
'blocksize' setting. Disable it to force the manually set 'blocksize' value.
.
:CONFIG_COMPRESSOR
Enable the auto-leveling compressor on the master channel to prevent clipping
of the audio output:
  off:  Disable compressor.
  on:   Enable compressor (default).
.
:CONFIG_CROSSFEED
Set crossfeed on the OPL and CMS (Gameblaster) mixer channels. Many games pan
the instruments 100%% left and 100%% right in the stereo field on these audio
devices which is unpleasant to listen to in headphones. With crossfeed enabled,
a portion of the left channel signal is mixed into the right channel and vice
versa, creating a more natural listening experience.
  off:     No crossfeed (default).
  on:      Enable crossfeed (normal preset).
  light:   Light crossfeed (strength 15).
  normal:  Normal crossfeed (strength 40).
  strong:  Strong crossfeed (strength 65).

Notes:
  - Use the MIXER command to apply crossfeed to other audio channels as well
    and to fine-tune the crossfeed strength per channel.
.
:CONFIG_REVERB
Reverb effect that adds a sense of space to the sound:
  off:     No reverb (default).
  on:      Enable reverb (medium preset).
  tiny:    Simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a room;
           specifically designed for small-speaker audio systems
           (PC speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and LPT DAC devices).
  small:   Adds a subtle sense of space; good for games that use a single
           synth channel (typically OPL) for both music and sound effects.
  medium:  Medium room preset that works well with a wide variety of games.
  large:   Large hall preset recommended for games that use separate
           channels for music and digital audio.
  huge:    A stronger variant of the large hall preset; works really well
           in some games with more atmospheric soundtracks.

Notes:
  - The presets apply a noticeable amount of reverb to the synth mixer channels
    (except for synths with built-in reverb; e.g., the Roland MT-32), and a
    subtle amount to the digital audio channels.
  - Use the MIXER command to fine-tune the reverb levels per channel.
.
:CONFIG_CHORUS
Chorus effect that adds a sense of stereo movement to the sound:
  off:     No chorus (default).
  on:      Enable chorus (normal preset).
  light:   A light chorus effect (especially suited for synth music that
           features lots of white noise).
  normal:  Normal chorus that works well with a wide variety of games.
  strong:  An obvious and upfront chorus effect.

Notes:
  - The presets apply the chorus effect to the synth channels only (except
    for synths with built-in chorus; e.g. the Roland MT-32).
  - Use the MIXER command to fine-tune the chorus levels per channel.
.
:CONFIG_DENOISER
Remove low-level residual noise from the output of the OPL synth and the Roland
Sound Canvas. The emulation of these devices is accurate to the original
hardware units, which includes the emulation of a very low-level semi-random
noise. Although this is authentic, most people would find it slightly annoying.
  off:  Disable the denoiser.
  on:   Enable the denoiser on the OPL and SOUNDCANVAS channels (default).
        The denoiser does not introduce any sound quality degradation; it only
        removes the barely audible residual noise in quiet passages.
.
:CONFIG_SOUNDFONT
Name or path of SoundFont file to use ('default.sf2' by default).
The SoundFont will be looked up in the following locations in order:
  - The user-defined SoundFont directory (see 'soundfont_dir').
  - The 'soundfonts' directory in your DOSBox configuration directory.
  - Other common system locations.
The '.sf2' extension can be omitted. You can use paths relative to the above
locations or absolute paths as well.
Note: Run `MIXER /LISTMIDI` to see the list of available SoundFonts.
.
:CONFIG_SOUNDFONT_DIR
Extra user-defined SoundFont directory (unset by default).
If this is set, SoundFonts are looked up in this directory first, then in the
the standard system locations.
.
:CONFIG_SOUNDFONT_VOLUME
Set the SoundFont's volume as a percentage (100 by default).
This is useful for normalising the volume of different SoundFonts.
The percentage value can range from 1 to 800.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_CHORUS
Configure the FluidSynth chorus. Possible values:
  auto:      Enable chorus, except for known problematic SoundFonts (default).
  on:        Always enable chorus.
  off:       Disable chorus.
  <custom>:  Custom setting via five space-separated values:
               - voice-count:      Integer from 0 to 99
               - level:            Decimal from 0.0 to 10.0
               - speed:            Decimal from 0.1 to 5.0 (in Hz)
               - depth:            Decimal from 0.0 to 21.0
               - modulation-wave:  'sine' or 'triangle'
             For example: 'fsynth_chorus = 3 1.2 0.3 8.0 sine'
Note: You can disable the FluidSynth chorus and enable the mixer-level chorus
      on the FluidSynth channel instead, or enable both chorus effects at the
      same time. Whether this sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the
      chorus settings being used.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_REVERB
Configure the FluidSynth reverb. Possible values:
  auto:      Enable reverb (default).
  on:        Enable reverb.
  off:       Disable reverb.
  <custom>:  Custom setting via four space-separated values:
               - room-size:  Decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
               - damping:    Decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
               - width is:   Decimal from 0.0 to 100.0
               - level is:   Decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
             For example: 'fsynth_reverb = 0.61 0.23 0.76 0.56'
Note: You can disable the FluidSynth reverb and enable the mixer-level reverb
      on the FluidSynth channel instead, or enable both reverb effects at the
      same time. Whether this sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the
      reverb settings being used.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_FILTER
Filter for the FluidSynth audio output:
  off:       Don't filter the output (default).
  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:FLUIDSYNTH_NO_SOUNDFONTS
No available SoundFonts
.
:CONFIG_MODEL
The Roland MT-32/CM-32ML model to use.
You must have the ROM files for the selected model available (see 'romdir').
The lookup for the best models is performed in order as listed.
  auto:       Pick the best available model (default).
  cm32l:      Pick the best available CM-32L model.
  mt32_old:   Pick the best available "old" MT-32 model (v1.0x).
  mt32_new:   Pick the best available "new" MT-32 model (v2.0x).
  mt32:       Pick the best available MT-32 model.
  <version>:  Use the exact specified model version (e.g., 'mt32_204').
Notes:
  - Run `MIXER /LISTMIDI` to see the list of available models.
  - This is *NOT* a General MIDI compatible MIDI device; only use it if the
    game is known to support Roland MT-32 MIDI (which predates General MIDI).

.
:CONFIG_ROMDIR
The directory containing the Roland MT-32/CM-32ML ROMs (unset by default).
The directory can be absolute or relative, or leave it unset to use the
'mt32-roms' directory in your DOSBox configuration directory. Other common
system locations will be checked as well.
Notes:
  - The file names of the ROM files do not matter; the ROMS are identified
    by their checksums.
  - Both interleaved and non-interlaved ROM files are supported.
.
:CONFIG_MT32_FILTER
Filter for the Roland MT-32/CM-32L audio output:
  off:       Don't filter the output (default).
  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:MT32_ROMS_LABEL
MT-32  models   
.
:CM32L_ROMS_LABEL
CM-32L models   
.
:MT32_ACTIVE_MODEL_LABEL
Active model  
.
:MT32_SOURCE_DIR_LABEL
ROM path      
.
:CONFIG_SOUNDCANVAS_MODEL
The Roland Sound Canvas model to use.
One or more CLAP audio plugins that implement the supported Sound Canvas
models must be present in the 'plugins' directory in your DOSBox installation
or configuration directory. DOSBox searches for the requested model by
inspecting the plugin descriptions. The lookup for the best model is
performed in order as listed.
  auto:       Pick the best available model (default).
  sc55:       Pick the best available original SC-55 model.
  sc55mk2:    Pick the best available SC-55mk2 model.
  <version>:  Use the exact specified model version (e.g., 'sc55_121').
.
:CONFIG_SOUNDCANVAS_FILTER
Filter for the Roland Sound Canvas audio output:
  on:        Filter the output (default).
  off:       Don't filter the output.
  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:SC55_MODELS_LABEL
SC-55 models    
.
:SOUNDCANVAS_ACTIVE_MODEL_LABEL
Active model:    
.
:CONFIG_MIDIDEVICE
Set where MIDI data from the emulated MPU-401 MIDI interface is sent
('port' by default):
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDIDEVICE_PORT
  port:         A MIDI port of the host operating system's MIDI interface
                (default). You can configure the port to use with the
                'midiconfig' setting.
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDIDEVICE_COREAUDIO
  coreaudio:    The built-in macOS MIDI synthesiser. The SoundFont to use can
                be specified with the 'midiconfig' setting.
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDIDEVICE_MT32
  mt32:         The internal Roland MT-32 synthesizer (see the [mt32] section).
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDIDEVICE_SOUNDCANVAS
  soundcanvas:  The internal Roland SC-55 synthesiser (see the [soundcanvas]
                section).
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDIDEVICE_FLUIDSYNTH
  fluidsynth:   The internal FluidSynth MIDI synthesizer (SoundFont player)
                (see the [fluidsynth] section).
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDIDEVICE_NONE
  none:         Disable MIDI output.
.
:CONFIG_MIDICONFIG
Configuration options for the selected MIDI device (unset by default).
Notes:
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDICONFIG_WINDOWS_OR_MACOS
  - When using 'mididevice = port', find the ID or name of the MIDI port you
    want to use with the DOS command 'MIXER /LISTMIDI', then set either the ID
    or a substring of the name (e.g., to use the port called "loopMIDI Port A"
    with ID 2, set 'midiconfig = 2' or 'midiconfig = port a').
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDICONFIG_COREAUDIO
  - When using 'mididevice = coreaudio', this setting specifies the SoundFont
    to use. You must use the absolute path of the SoundFont file.
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDICONFIG_LINUX
  - When using 'mididevice = port', use the Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list
    all open MIDI ports and select one (e.g., 'midiconfig = 14:0' for sequencer
    client 14, port 0).
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDICONFIG_INTERNAL_SYNTH
  - The setting has no effect when using the internal synthesizers
    ('mididevice = fluidsynth', 'mt32', or 'soundcanvas').
.
:CONFIGITEM_MIDICONFIG_PHYSICAL_MT32
  - If you're using a physical rev.0 Roland MT-32, the hardware may require a
    delay to prevent buffer overflows. You can enable this with 'delaysysex'
    after the port ID or name (e.g., 'midiconfig = 2 delaysysex').
.
:CONFIG_MPU401
MPU-401 mode to emulate ('intelligent' by default).
.
:CONFIG_RAW_MIDI_OUTPUT
Enable raw, unaltered MIDI output ('off' by default).
The MIDI drivers of many games don't fully conform to the MIDI standard,
which makes editing the MIDI recordings of these games very error-prone and
cumbersome in MIDI sequencers, often resulting in hanging or missing notes.
DOSBox corrects the MIDI output of such games by default. This results in no
audible difference whatsoever; it only affects the representation of the MIDI
data. You should only enable 'raw_midi_output' if you really need to capture
the raw, unaltered MIDI output of a program, e.g. when working with music
applications, or when debugging MIDI issues.
.
:MIDI_DEVICE_LIST_NOT_SUPPORTED
Listing not supported
.
:MIDI_DEVICE_NOT_CONFIGURED
Device not configured
.
:MIDI_DEVICE_NO_PORTS
No available ports
.
:MIDI_DEVICE_NO_MODEL_ACTIVE
No model is currently active
.
:MIDI_DEVICE_NO_MODELS
No available models
.
:CONFIG_SBTYPE
Sound Blaster model to emulate ('sb16' by default).
The models auto-selected with 'oplmode' and 'cms' on 'auto' are also listed.
  gb:        Game Blaster          - CMS
  sb1:       Sound Blaster 1.0     - OPL2, CMS
  sb2:       Sound Blaster 2.0     - OPL2
  sbpro1:    Sound Blaster Pro     - Dual OPL2
  sbpro2:    Sound Blaster Pro 2   - OPL3
  sb16:      Sound Blaster 16      - OPL3 (default)
  ess:       ESS ES1688 AudioDrive - ESFM
  none/off:  Disable Sound Blaster emulation.
Notes:
  - Creative Music System was later rebranded to Game Blaster; they are the
    same card.
  - The 'ess' option is for getting ESS Enhanced FM music via the card's ESFM
    synthesiser in games that support it. The ESS DAC is not emulated but the
    card is Sound Blaster Pro compatible; just configure the game for Sound
    Blaster digital sound.
.
:CONFIG_SBBASE
The IO address of the Sound Blaster (220 by default).
.
:CONFIG_IRQ
The IRQ number of the Sound Blaster (7 by default).
.
:CONFIG_DMA
The DMA channel of the Sound Blaster (1 by default).
.
:CONFIG_HDMA
The High DMA channel of the Sound Blaster 16 (5 by default).
.
:CONFIG_SBMIXER
Allow the Sound Blaster mixer to modify volume levels ('on' by default).
Sound Blaster Pro 1 and later cards allow programs to set the volume of the
digital audio (DAC), FM synth, and CD Audio output. These correspond to the
SB, OPL, and CDAUDIO DOSBox mixer channels, respectively.
  on:   The final level of the above channels is a combination of the volume
        set by the program, and the volume set in the DOSBox mixer.
  off:  Only the DOSBox mixer determines the volume of these channels.
Note: Some games change the volume levels dynamically (e.g., lower the FM music
      volume when speech is playing); it's best to leave 'sbmixer' enabled for
      such games.
.
:CONFIG_SBWARMUP
Silence initial DMA audio after card power-on, in milliseconds
(100 by default). This mitigates pops heard when starting many SB-based games.
Reduce this if you notice intial playback is missing audio.
.
:CONFIG_SB_FILTER
Type of filter to emulate for the Sound Blaster digital sound output:
  auto:      Use the appropriate filter determined by 'sbtype'.
  sb1, sb2, sbpro1, sbpro2, sb16:
             Use the filter of this Sound Blaster model.
  modern:    Use linear interpolation upsampling that acts as a low-pass
             filter; this is the legacy DOSBox behaviour (default).
  off:       Don't filter the output.
  <custom>:  One or two custom filters in the following format:
               TYPE ORDER FREQ
             Where TYPE can be 'hpf' (high-pass) or 'lpf' (low-pass),
             ORDER is the order of the filter from 1 to 16
             (1st order = 6dB/oct slope, 2nd order = 12dB/oct, etc.),
             and FREQ is the cutoff frequency in Hz. Examples:
                lpf 2 12000
                hpf 3 120 lfp 1 6500
.
:CONFIG_SB_FILTER_ALWAYS_ON
Force the Sound Blaster Pro 2 filter to be always on ('off' by default).
Other Sound Blaster models don't allow toggling the filter in software.
.
:CONFIG_OPLRATE
The OPL output is now transparently resampled to the mixer's sample rate.
.
:CONFIG_OPLMODE
OPL model to emulate ('auto' by default).
  auto:      Use the appropriate model determined by 'sbtype'.
  opl2:      Yamaha OPL2 (YM3812, mono).
  dualopl2:  Dual OPL2 (two OPL2 chips in stereo configuration).
  opl3:      Yamaha OPL3 (YMF262, stereo).
  opl3gold:  OPL3 and the optional AdLib Gold Surround module.
             Use with 'sbtype = sb16' to emulate the AdLib Gold 1000.
  esfm:      ESS ESFM (enhanced Yamaha OPL3 compatible FM synth).
  none/off:  Disable OPL emulation.
Notes:
  - 'sbtype = none' and 'oplmode = opl2' emulates the original AdLib card.
  - Only 'oplmode = esfm' is not enough to get ESS Enhanced FM music in games;
    you'll also need to set 'sbtype = ess'. 'oplmode = esfm' is useful to
    get ESFM-flavoured OPL with original Sound Blaster models.
.
:CONFIG_OPL_FADEOUT
Fade out hanging notes on the OPL synth:
  off:       Don't fade out hanging notes (default).
  fade:      Fade out hanging notes. You should only enable this in games that
             sometimes play hanging notes that never stop (e.g., Bard's Tale).
  <custom>:  A custom fade-out definition in the following format:
               WAIT FADE
             Where WAIT is how long after the last I/O port write fading begins
             (between 100 and 5000 milliseconds); and FADE is the fade-out
             period (between 10 and 3000 milliseconds).
             Examples:
               300 200   (wait 300 ms before fading out over a 200 ms period)
               1000 3000 (wait 1 second before fading out over 3 seconds)
.
:CONFIG_OPL_REMOVE_DC_BIAS
Remove DC bias from the OPL output. This should only be used as a last resort
to fix popping in games that play PCM audio using the OPL synthesiser on a
Sound Blaster or AdLib card, such as in: Golden Eagle (1991), Wizardry 6
(1990), and Wizardry 7 (1992). Please open an issue ticket if you find other
affected games.
.
:CONFIG_OPLEMU
Only 'nuked' OPL emulation is supported now.
.
:CONFIG_OPL_FILTER
Type of filter to emulate for the Sound Blaster OPL output:
  auto:      Use the appropriate filter determined by 'sbtype' (default).
  sb1, sb2, sbpro1, sbpro2, sb16:
             Use the filter of this Sound Blaster model.
  off:       Don't filter the output.
  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:CONFIG_CMS
Enable CMS emulation ('auto' by default).
  off:   Disable CMS emulation (except when the Game Blaster is selected).
  on:    Enable CMS emulation on Sound Blaster 1 and 2.
  auto:  Auto-enable CMS emulation for Sound Blaster 1 and Game Blaster.
.
:CONFIG_CMS_FILTER
Filter for the Sound Blaster CMS output:
  on:        Filter the output (default).
  off:       Don't filter the output.
  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:CONFIG_GUS
Enable Gravis UltraSound emulation ('off' by default).
Many games and all demos upload their own sounds, but some rely on the
instrument patch files included with the GUS for MIDI playback (see 'ultradir'
for details). Some games also require ULTRAMID.EXE to be loaded prior to
starting the game.

Note: The default settings of base address 240, IRQ 5, and DMA 3 have been
      chosen so the GUS can coexist with a Sound Blaster card. This works fine
      for the majority of programs, but some games and demos expect the GUS
      factory defaults of base address 220, IRQ 11, and DMA 1. The default
      IRQ 11 is also problematic with specific versions of the DOS4GW extender
      that cannot handle IRQs above 7.
.
:CONFIG_GUSBASE
The IO base address of the Gravis UltraSound (240 by default).
.
:CONFIG_GUSIRQ
The IRQ number of the Gravis UltraSound (5 by default).
.

  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:CONFIG_ULTRADIR
Path to the UltraSound directory ('C:\ULTRASND' by default).
This should have a 'MIDI' subdirectory containing the patches (instrument
files) required by some games for MIDI music playback. Not all games need these
patches; many GUS-native games and all demos upload their own custom sounds
instead.
.
:CONFIG_IMFC
Enable the IBM Music Feature Card ('off' by default).
.
:CONFIG_IMFC_BASE
The IO base address of the IBM Music Feature Card ('2A20' by default).
.
:CONFIG_IMFC_IRQ
The IRQ number of the IBM Music Feature Card (3 by default).
.
:CONFIG_IMFC_FILTER
Filter for the IBM Music Feature Card output:
  on:        Filter the output (default).
  off:       Don't filter the output.
  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:CONFIG_SIDMODEL
Model of chip to emulate in the Innovation SSI-2001 card:
  auto:  Use the 6581 chip.

  hardsid:  1.000 MHz, available on the DuoSID.
.
:CONFIG_SIDPORT
The IO port address of the Innovation SSI-2001 (280 by default).
.
:CONFIG_6581FILTER
Adjusts the 6581's filtering strength as a percentage from 0 to 100
(50 by default). The SID's analog filtering meant that each chip was
physically unique.
.
:CONFIG_8580FILTER
Adjusts the 8580's filtering strength as a percentage from 0 to 100
(50 by default).
.
:CONFIG_INNOVATION_FILTER
Filter for the Innovation audio output:
  off:       Don't filter the output (default).
  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:CONFIG_PCSPEAKER
PC speaker emulation model:
  impulse:   A very faithful emulation of the PC speaker's output (default).
             Works with most games, but may result in garbled sound or silence
             in a small number of programs.
  discrete:  Legacy simplified PC speaker emulation; only use this on specific
             titles that give you problems with the 'impulse' model.
  none/off:  Don't emulate the PC speaker.
.
:CONFIG_PCSPEAKER_FILTER
Filter for the PC speaker output:
  on:        Filter the output (default).
  off:       Don't filter the output.

.
:CONFIG_ZERO_OFFSET
DC-offset is now eliminated globally from the master mixer output.
.
:CONFIG_TANDY
Set the Tandy/PCjr 3 Voice sound emulation:
  auto:  Automatically enable Tandy/PCjr sound for the 'tandy' and 'pcjr'
         machine types only (default).
  on:    Enable Tandy/PCjr sound with DAC support, when possible.
         Most games also need the machine set to 'tandy' or 'pcjr' to work.
  psg:   Only enable the card's three-voice programmable sound generator
         without DAC to avoid conflicts with other cards using DMA 1.
  off:   Disable Tandy/PCjr sound.
.
:CONFIG_TANDY_FADEOUT
Fade out the Tandy synth output after the last IO port write:
  off:       Don't fade out; residual output will play forever (default).

             or visible in DOS.
Remember to reset DOSBox's mapperfile if you saved it earlier.
.
:CONFIG_TIMED
Enable timed intervals for axis ('on' by default).
Experiment with this option, if your joystick drifts away.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOFIRE
Fire continuously as long as the button is pressed ('off' by default)
.
:CONFIG_SWAP34
Swap the 3rd and the 4th axis ('off' by default). Can be useful for certain
joysticks.
.
:CONFIG_BUTTONWRAP
Enable button wrapping at the number of emulated buttons ('off' by default).
.
:CONFIG_CIRCULARINPUT
Enable translation of circular input to square output ('off' by default).
Try enabling this if your left analog stick can only move in a circle.
.
:CONFIG_DEADZONE
Percentage of motion to ignore (10 by default).
100 turns the stick into a digital one.
.
:CONFIG_USE_JOY_CALIBRATION_HOTKEYS
Enable hotkeys to allow realtime calibration of the joystick's X and Y axes
('off' by default). Only consider this as a last resort if in-game calibration
doesn't work correctly.
  - Ctrl/Cmd+Arrow-keys adjust the axis' scalar value:
      - Left and Right diminish or magnify the x-axis scalar, respectively.
      - Down and Up diminish or magnify the y-axis scalar, respectively.
  - Alt+Arrow-keys adjust the axis' offset position:
      - Left and Right shift X-axis offset in the given direction.
      - Down and Up shift the Y-axis offset in the given direction.
  - Reset the X and Y calibration using Ctrl+Delete and Ctrl+Home,
    respectively.
Each tap will report X or Y calibration values you can set below. When you find
parameters that work, quit the game, switch this setting back to disabled, and
populate the reported calibration parameters.
.
:CONFIG_JOY_X_CALIBRATION
Apply X-axis calibration parameters from the hotkeys ('auto' by default).
.
:CONFIG_JOY_Y_CALIBRATION
Apply Y-axis calibration parameters from the hotkeys ('auto' by default).
.
:CONFIG_SERIAL1
Set type of device connected to the COM1 port.
Can be disabled, dummy, mouse, modem, nullmodem, direct ('dummy' by default).
Additional parameters must be on the same line in the form of
parameter:value. The optional 'irq' parameter is common for all types.
  - for 'mouse':      model (optional; overrides the 'com_mouse_model' setting).
  - for 'direct':     realport (required), rxdelay (optional).
                      (e.g., realport:COM1, realport:ttyS0).
  - for 'modem':      listenport, sock, bps (all optional).
  - for 'nullmodem':  server, rxdelay, txdelay, telnet, usedtr,
                      transparent, port, inhsocket, sock (all optional).
The 'sock' parameter specifies the protocol to use at both sides of the
connection. Valid values are 0 for TCP, and 1 for ENet reliable UDP.
Example: serial1=modem listenport:5000 sock:1
.
:CONFIG_SERIAL2
See 'serial1' ('dummy' by default).
.
:CONFIG_SERIAL3

:CONFIG_EMS
Enable EMS support ('on' by default). Enabled provides the best compatibility
but certain applications may run better with other choices, or require EMS
support to be disabled to work at all.
.
:CONFIG_UMB
Enable UMB support ('on' by default).
.
:CONFIG_PCJR_MEMORY_CONFIG
PCjr memory layout ('expanded' by default).
  expanded:  640 KB total memory with applications residing above 128 KB.
             Compatible with most games.
  standard:  128 KB total memory with applications residing below 96 KB.
             Required for some older games (e.g., Jumpman, Troll).
.
:CONFIG_VER
Set DOS version (5.0 by default). Specify in major.minor format.
A single number is treated as the major version.
Common settings are 3.3, 5.0, 6.22, and 7.1.
.
:CONFIG_LOCALE_PERIOD
Set locale epoch ('native' by default).
  historic:  If data is available for the given country, mimic old DOS behavior
             when displaying time, dates, or numbers.
  modern:    Follow current day practices for user experience more consistent
             with typical host systems.
  native:    Re-use current host OS settings, regardless of the country set;
             use 'modern' data to fill-in the gaps when the DOS locale system
             is too limited to follow the desktop settings.
.
:CONFIG_COUNTRY
Set DOS country code ('auto' by default).
This affects country-specific information such as date, time, and decimal
formats. If set to 'auto', selects the country code reflecting the host
OS settings.
The list of country codes can be displayed using '--list-countries'
command-line argument.
.
:CONFIG_KEYBOARDLAYOUT
Renamed to 'keyboard_layout'.
.
:CONFIG_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT
Keyboard layout code ('auto' by default).
The list of supported keyboard layout codes can be displayed using the
'--list-layouts' command-line argument, e.g., 'uk' is the British English
layout. The layout can be followed by the code page number, e.g., 'uk 850'
selects a Western European screen font.
Set to 'auto' to guess the values from the host OS settings.
After startup, use the 'KEYB' command to manage keyboard layouts and code pages
(run 'HELP KEYB' for details).
.
:CONFIG_EXPAND_SHELL_VARIABLE
Enable expanding environment variables such as %%PATH%% in the DOS command shell
(auto by default, enabled if DOS version >= 7.0).
FreeDOS and MS-DOS 7/8 COMMAND.COM supports this behavior.
.
:CONFIG_SHELL_HISTORY_FILE
File containing persistent command line history ('shell_history.txt'
by default). Setting it to empty disables persistent shell history.
.
:CONFIG_SETVER_TABLE_FILE
File containing the list of applications and assigned DOS versions, in a
tab-separated format, used by SETVER.EXE as a persistent storage
(empty by default).
.
:CONFIG_FILE_LOCKING
Enable file locking (SHARE.EXE emulation; 'on' by default).
This is required for some Windows 3.1x applications to work properly.
It generally does not cause problems for DOS games except in rare cases
(e.g., Astral Blur demo). If you experience crashes related to file
permissions, you can try disabling this.
.
:CONFIGITEM_IPX
Enable IPX over UDP/IP emulation ('off' by default).
.
:CONFIGITEM_NE2000_SLIRP
Enable emulation of a Novell NE2000 network card on a software-based
network (using libslirp) with properties as follows ('on' by default):
  - 255.255.255.0:  Subnet mask of the 10.0.2.0 virtual LAN.
  - 10.0.2.2:       IP of the gateway and DHCP service.
  - 10.0.2.3:       IP of the virtual DNS server.
  - 10.0.2.15:      First IP provided by DHCP, your IP!
Note: Inside DOS, setting this up requires an NE2000 packet driver, DHCP
      client, and TCP/IP stack. You might need port-forwarding from the host
      into the DOS guest, and from your router to your host when acting as the
      server for multiplayer games.
.
:CONFIGITEM_NICBASE_SLIRP
Base address of the NE2000 card (300 by default).
Note: Addresses 220 and 240 might not be available as they're assigned to the
      Sound Blaster and Gravis UltraSound by default.
.
:CONFIGITEM_NICIRQ_SLIRP
The interrupt used by the NE2000 card (3 by default).
Note: IRQs 3 and 5 might not be available as they're assigned to
      'serial2' and the Gravis UltraSound by default.
.
:CONFIGITEM_MACADDR_SLIRP
The MAC address of the NE2000 card ('AC:DE:48:88:99:AA' by default).
.
:CONFIGITEM_TCP_PORT_FORWARDS_SLIRP
Forward one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest
(unset by default).
The format is:
  port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
  This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
  host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
  This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest.
A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
  start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
  This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
  hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
  This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest.
Notes:
  - If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
  - If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
  - If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
.
:CONFIGITEM_UDP_PORT_FORWARDS_SLIRP
Forward one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest
(unset by default). The format is the same as for TCP port forwards.
.
:AUTOEXEC_CONFIGFILE_HELP

:PROGRAM_AUTOTYPE_HELP_LONG
Perform scripted keyboard entry into a running DOS game.

Usage:
  [color=light-green]autotype[reset] -list
  [color=light-green]autotype[reset] [-w [color=white]WAIT[reset]] [-p [color=white]PACE[reset]] [color=light-cyan]BUTTONS[reset]

Parameters:
  [color=white]WAIT[reset]     number of seconds to wait before typing begins (max of 30)
  [color=white]PACE[reset]     number of seconds before each keystroke (max of 10)
  [color=light-cyan]BUTTONS[reset]  one or more space-separated buttons

Notes:
  The [color=light-cyan]BUTTONS[reset] supplied in the command will be autotyped into running DOS games
  after they start. Autotyping begins after [color=light-cyan]WAIT[reset] seconds, and each button is
  entered every [color=white]PACE[reset] seconds. The [color=light-cyan],[reset] character inserts an extra [color=white]PACE[reset] delay.
  [color=white]WAIT[reset] and [color=white]PACE[reset] default to 2 and 0.5 seconds respectively if not specified.
  A list of all available button names can be obtained using the -list option.

Examples:
  [color=light-green]autotype[reset] -list
  [color=light-green]autotype[reset] -w [color=white]1[reset] -p [color=white]0.3[reset] [color=light-cyan]up enter , right enter[reset]

Usage:
  [color=light-green]boot[reset] [color=white]DRIVE[reset]
  [color=light-green]boot[reset] [color=light-cyan]IMAGEFILE[reset]

Parameters:
  [color=white]DRIVE[reset]      drive to boot from, must be [color=white]A:[reset], [color=white]C:[reset], or [color=white]D:[reset]
  [color=light-cyan]IMAGEFILE[reset]  one or more floppy images, separated by spaces

Notes:
  A DOS drive letter must have been mounted previously with [color=light-green]imgmount[reset] command.
  The DOS drive or disk image must be bootable, containing DOS system files.
  If more than one disk images are specified, you can swap them with a hotkey.

Examples:
  [color=light-green]boot[reset] [color=white]c:[reset]
  [color=light-green]boot[reset] [color=light-cyan]disk1.ima disk2.ima[reset]

For this command, one can specify a succession of floppy disks swappable by
pressing [color=yellow]%s+F4[reset], and -l specifies the mounted drive to boot from. If no drive
letter is specified, this defaults to booting from the A drive. The only
bootable drive letters are A, C, and D. For booting from a hard drive (C or D),
the image should have already been mounted using the [color=light-blue]IMGMOUNT[reset] command.

Type [color=light-blue]BOOT /?[reset] for the syntax of this command.

the files as read-only.
Usually this is enough for most games:
[color=light-blue]mount D C:\example -t cdrom[reset]
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:
[color=light-blue]mount D C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[reset]

Additionally, you can use [color=light-blue]imgmount[reset] to mount ISO or CUE/BIN images:

:PROGRAM_KEYB_HELP_LONG
Configure a keyboard layout and screen font.

Usage:
  [color=light-green]keyb[reset]
  [color=light-green]keyb[reset] /list
  [color=light-green]keyb[reset] [color=light-cyan]LAYOUT[reset] [[color=white]CODEPAGE[reset]] /rom
  [color=light-green]keyb[reset] [color=light-cyan]LAYOUT[reset] [[color=white]CODEPAGE[reset] [[color=white]CPIFILE[reset]]]

Parameters:
  [color=light-cyan]LAYOUT[reset]    keyboard layout code
  [color=white]CODEPAGE[reset]  code page number, e.g. [color=white]437[reset] or [color=white]850[reset]
  [color=white]CPIFILE[reset]   screen font file, in CPI format
  /list     display available keyboard layout codes
  /rom      use screen font from display adapter ROM if possible

Notes:
  - Running [color=light-green]keyb[reset] without an argument shows the currently loaded keyboard layout
    and code page.
  - The [color=white]CPIFILE[reset], if specified, must contain the screen font for the given
    [color=white]CODEPAGE[reset].
  - MS-DOS, DR-DOS, and Windows NT formats of the CPI files are supported
    directly. The FreeDOS CPX files have to be uncompressed first with the 3rd
    party [color=light-green]upx[reset] tool.
  - If no custom [color=white]CPIFILE[reset] is specified, the command looks for a suitable screen
    font in the bundled CPI files.
  - If [color=white]CODEPAGE[reset] is not specified, and the screen font from the display adapter
    ROM is suitable, it uses the ROM screen font.
  - Only EGA or better display adapters allow to change the screen font; MDA,
    CGA, or Hercules always use the ROM screen font.
  - You can use the 'us' keyboard layout with any code page; all the other
    layouts work with selected code pages only.

Examples:
  [color=light-green]KEYB[reset]
  [color=light-green]KEYB[reset] [color=light-cyan]uk[reset]
  [color=light-green]KEYB[reset] [color=light-cyan]sp[reset] [color=white]850[reset]
