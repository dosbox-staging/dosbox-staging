:DOSBOX_HELP
Usage: %s [OPTION]... [PATH]

PATH                       If PATH is a directory, it's mounted as C:.
                           If PATH is a bootable disk image (IMA/IMG), it's booted.
                           If PATH is a CD-ROM image (CUE/ISO), it's mounted as D:.
                           If PATH is a DOS executable (BAT/COM/EXE), it's parent
                           path is mounted as C: and the executable is run. When
                           the executable exits, DOSBox Staging quits.

List of available options:

  --conf <config_file>     Start with the options specified in <config_file>.

:CONFIG_FULLSCREEN
Start directly in fullscreen (disabled by default).
Run INTRO and see Special Keys for window control hotkeys.
.
:CONFIG_DISPLAY
Number of display to use; values depend on OS and user settings (0 by default).
.
:CONFIG_FULLRESOLUTION
What resolution to use for fullscreen: 'original', 'desktop'
or a fixed size, e.g. 1024x768 ('desktop' by default).
.
:CONFIG_WINDOWRESOLUTION
Set intial window size for windowed mode. You can still resize the window
after startup.
  default:   Select the best option based on your environment and other
             settings (such as whether aspect ratio correction is enabled).
  small, medium, large (s, m, l):
             Size the window relative to the desktop.
  WxH:       Specify window size in WxH format in logical units
             (e.g., 1024x768).
.
:CONFIG_WINDOW_POSITION
Set initial window position for windowed mode:
  auto:      Let the window manager decide the position (default).
  X,Y:       Set window position in X,Y format (e.g., 250,100).
             0,0 is the top-left corner of the screen.
.
:CONFIG_WINDOW_DECORATIONS
Enable window decorations in windowed mode (enabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_TRANSPARENCY
Set the transparency of the DOSBox Staging screen (0 by default).
From 0 (no transparency) to 90 (high transparency).
.
:CONFIG_MAX_RESOLUTION
Moved to [render] section and renamed to 'viewport'.
.
:CONFIG_VIEWPORT_RESOLUTION
Moved to [render] section and renamed to 'viewport'.
.
:CONFIG_HOST_RATE
Set the host's refresh rate:
  auto:      Use SDI rates, or VRR rates when in fullscreen on a high-refresh
             rate display (default).
  sdi:       Use serial device interface (SDI) rates, without further
             adjustment.
  vrr:       Deduct 3 Hz from the reported rate (best practice for VRR
             displays).
  N:         Specify custom refresh rate in Hz (decimal values are allowed;
             23.000 is the allowed minimum).
.
:CONFIG_VSYNC
Set the host video driver's vertical synchronization (vsync) mode:
  auto:      Limit vsync to beneficial cases, such as when using an
             interpolating VRR display in fullscreen (default).
  on:        Enable vsync. This can prevent tearing in some games but will
             impact performance or drop frames when the DOS rate exceeds the
             host rate (e.g. 70 Hz DOS rate vs 60 Hz host rate).
  adaptive:  Enables vsync when the frame rate is higher than the host rate,
             but disables it when the frame rate drops below the host rate.
             This is a reasonable alternative on macOS instead of 'on'.
             Note: only valid in OpenGL output modes; otherwise treated as
             'on'.
  off:       Attempt to disable vsync to allow quicker frame presentation at
             the risk of tearing in some games.
  yield:     Let the host's video driver control video synchronization.
.
:CONFIG_VSYNC_SKIP
Number of microseconds to allow rendering to block before skipping the
next frame. For example, a value of 7000 is roughly half the frame time
at 70 Hz. 0 disables this and will always render (default).
.
:CONFIG_PRESENTATION_MODE
Select the frame presentation mode:
  auto:  Intelligently time and drop frames to prevent emulation stalls,
         based on host and DOS frame rates (default).
  cfr:   Always present DOS frames at a constant frame rate.
  vfr:   Always present changed DOS frames at a variable frame rate.
.
:CONFIG_OUTPUT
Video system to use for output ('opengl' by default).
'texture' and 'opengl' use bilinear interpolation, 'texturenb' and
'openglnb' use nearest-neighbour (no-bilinear). Some shaders require
bilinear interpolation, making that the safest choice.
.
:CONFIG_TEXTURE_RENDERER
Render driver to use in 'texture' output mode ('auto' by default).
Use 'texture_renderer = auto' for an automatic choice.
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURE_MOUSE
Moved to [mouse] section and renamed to 'mouse_capture'.
.
:CONFIG_SENSITIVITY
Moved to [mouse] section and renamed to 'mouse_sensitivity'.
.
:CONFIG_RAW_MOUSE_INPUT
Moved to [mouse] section and renamed to 'mouse_raw_input'.
.
:CONFIG_WAITONERROR
Keep the console open if an error has occurred (enabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_PRIORITY
Priority levels to apply when active and inactive, respectively.
('auto auto' by default)
'auto' lets the host operating system manage the priority.
.
:CONFIG_MUTE_WHEN_INACTIVE
Mute the sound when the window is inactive (disabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_PAUSE_WHEN_INACTIVE
Pause emulation when the window is inactive (disabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_MAPPERFILE
Path to the mapper file ('mapper-sdl2-XYZ.map' by default, where XYZ is the
current version). Pre-configured maps are bundled in 'resources/mapperfiles'.
These can be loaded by name, e.g., with 'mapperfile = xbox/xenon2.map'.
Note: The '--resetmapper' command line option only deletes the default mapper
      file.
.
:CONFIG_SCREENSAVER
Use 'allow' or 'block' to override the SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER environment
variable which usually blocks the OS screensaver while the emulator is
running ('auto' by default).
.
:CONFIG_LANGUAGE
Select a language to use: 'de', 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'it', 'nl', 'pl', or 'ru'
(unset by default; this defaults to English).
Notes:
  - This setting will override the 'LANG' environment variable, if set.
  - The bundled 'resources/translations' directory with the executable holds
    these files. Please keep it along-side the executable to support this
    feature.
.
:CONFIG_MACHINE
Set the video adapter or machine to emulate:
  hercules:       Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) (see 'monochrome_palette').
  cga_mono:       CGA adapter connected to a monochrome monitor (see
                  'monochrome_palette').
  cga:            IBM Color Graphics Adapter (CGA). Also enables composite
                  video emulation (see [composite] section).
  pcjr:           An IBM PCjr machine. Also enables PCjr sound and composite
                  video emulation (see [composite] section).
  tandy:          A Tandy 1000 machine with TGA graphics. Also enables Tandy
                  sound and composite video emulation (see [composite]
                  section).
  ega:            IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA).
  svga_paradise:  Paradise PVGA1A SVGA card (no VESA VBE; 512K vmem by default,
                  can be set to 256K or 1MB with 'vmemsize'). This is the
                  closest to IBM's original VGA adapter.
  svga_et3000:    Tseng Labs ET3000 SVGA card (no VESA VBE; fixed 512K vmem).
  svga_et4000:    Tseng Labs ET4000 SVGA card (no VESA VBE; 1MB vmem by
                  default, can be set to 256K or 512K with 'vmemsize').
  svga_s3:        S3 Trio64 (VESA VBE 2.0; 4MB vmem by default, can be set to
                  512K, 1MB, 2MB, or 8MB with 'vmemsize') (default)
  vesa_oldvbe:    Same as 'svga_s3' but limited to VESA VBE 1.2.
  vesa_nolfb:     Same as 'svga_s3' (VESA VBE 2.0), plus the "no linear
                  framebuffer" hack (needed only by a few games).
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURES
Moved to [capture] section and renamed to 'capture_dir'.
.
:CONFIG_MEMSIZE
Amount of memory of the emulated machine has in MB (16 by default).
Best leave at the default setting to avoid problems with some games,
though a few games might require a higher value.
There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
.
:CONFIG_MCB_FAULT_STRATEGY
How software-corrupted memory chain blocks should be handled:
  repair:  Repair (and report) faults using adjacent blocks (default).
  report:  Report faults but otherwise proceed as-is.
  allow:   Allow faults to go unreported (hardware behavior).
  deny:    Quit (and report) when faults are detected.
.
:CONFIG_VMEMSIZE
Video memory in MB (1-8) or KB (256 to 8192). 'auto' uses the default for
the selected video adapter ('auto' by default). See the 'machine' setting for
the list of valid options per adapter.
.
:CONFIG_DOS_RATE
Customize the emulated video mode's frame rate, in Hz:
  default:  The DOS video mode determines the rate (recommended; default).
  host:     Match the DOS rate to the host rate (see 'host_rate' setting).
  <value>:  Sets the rate to an exact value, between 24.000 and 1000.000 (Hz).
We recommend the 'default' rate; otherwise test and set on a per-game basis.
.
:CONFIG_VESA_MODES
Controls the selection of VESA 1.2 and 2.0 modes offered:
  compatible:  A tailored selection that maximizes game compatibility.
               This is recommended along with 4 or 8 MB of video memory
               (default).
  halfline:    Supports the low-resolution halfline VESA 2.0 mode used by
               Extreme Assault. Use only if needed, as it's not S3 compatible.
  all:         All modes for a given video memory size, however some games
               may not use them properly (flickering) or may need
               more system memory to use them.
.
:CONFIG_VGA_8DOT_FONT
Use 8-pixel-wide fonts on VGA adapters (disabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_SPEED_MODS
Permit changes known to improve performance (enabled by default).
Currently, no games are known to be negatively affected by this.
Please file a bug with the project if you find a game that fails
when this is enabled so we will list them here.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOEXEC_SECTION
How autoexec sections are handled from multiple config files:
  join:       Combine them into one big section (legacy behavior; default).
  overwrite:  Use the last one encountered, like other config settings.
.
:CONFIG_AUTOMOUNT
Mount 'drives/[c]' directories as drives on startup, where [c] is a lower-case
drive letter from 'a' to 'y' (enabled by default). The 'drives' folder can be
provided relative to the current directory or via built-in resources.
Mount settings can be optionally provided using a [c].conf file along-side
the drive's directory, with content as follows:
  [drive]
  type    = dir, overlay, floppy, or cdrom
  label   = custom_label
  path    = path-specification, ie: path = %%path%%;c:\tools
  override_drive = mount the directory to this drive instead (default empty)
  verbose = true or false
.
:CONFIG_STARTUP_VERBOSITY
Controls verbosity prior to displaying the program ('auto' by default):
  Verbosity   | Welcome | Early stdout
  high        |   yes   |    yes
  low         |   no    |    yes
  quiet       |   no    |    no
  auto        | 'low' if exec or dir is passed, otherwise 'high'
.
:CONFIG_ALLOW_WRITE_PROTECTED_FILES
Many games open all their files with writable permissions; even files that they
never modify. This setting lets you write-protect those files while still
allowing the game to read them (enabled by default). A second use-case: if
you're using a copy-on-write or network-based filesystem, this setting avoids
triggering write operations for these write-protected files.
.
:CONFIG_SHELL_CONFIG_SHORTCUTS
Allow shortcuts for simpler configuration management (enabled by default).
E.g., instead of 'config -set sbtype sb16', it is enough to execute
'sbtype sb16', and instead of 'config -get sbtype', you can just execute
the 'sbtype' command.
.
:CONFIG_FRAMESKIP
Consider capping frame rates using the 'host_rate' setting.
.
:CONFIG_ASPECT
Set the aspect ratio correction mode (enabled by default):
  auto, on:            Apply aspect ratio correction for modern square-pixel
                       flat-screen displays, so DOS video modes with non-square
                       pixels appear as they would on a 4:3 display aspect
                       ratio CRT monitor the majority of DOS games were
                       designed for. This setting only affects video modes that
                       use non-square pixels, such as 320x200 or 640x400;.
                       square-pixelmodes (e.g., 320x240, 640x480, and 800x600),
                       are displayed as-is.
  square-pixels, off:  Don't apply aspect ratio correction; all DOS video modes
                       are displayed with square pixels. Most 320x200 games
                       will appear squashed, but a minority of titles (e.g.,
                       DOS ports of PAL Amiga games) need square pixels to
                       appear as the artists intended.
  stretch:             Calculate the aspect ratio from the viewport's
                       dimensions. Combined with 'viewport', this mode is
                       useful to force arbitrary aspect ratios (e.g.,
                       stretching DOS games to fullscreen on 16:9 displays) and
                       to emulate the horizontal and vertical stretch controls
                       of CRT monitors.
.
:CONFIG_INTEGER_SCALING
Constrain the horizontal or vertical scaling factor to the largest integer
value so the image still fits into the viewport. The configured aspect ratio is
always maintained according to the 'aspect' and 'viewport' settings, which may
result in a non-integer scaling factor in the other dimension. If the image is
larger than the viewport, the integer scaling constraint is auto-disabled (same
as 'off'). Possible values:
  auto:        'vertical' mode auto-enabled for adaptive CRT shaders only
               (see 'glshader'), otherwise 'off' (default).
  vertical:    Constrain the vertical scaling factor to integer values.
               This is the recommended setting for CRT shaders to avoid uneven
               scanlines and interference artifacts.
  horizontal:  Constrain the horizontal scaling factor to integer values.
  off:         No integer scaling constraint is applied; the image fills the
               viewport while maintaining the configured aspect ratio.
.
:CONFIG_VIEWPORT
Set the viewport size (maximum drawable area). The video output is always
contained within the viewport while taking the configured aspect ratio into
account (see 'aspect'). Possible values:
  fit:             Fit the viewport into the available window/screen (default).
                   There might be padding (black areas) around the image with
                   'integer_scaling' enabled.
  WxH:             Set a fixed viewport size in WxH format in logical units
                   (e.g., 960x720). The specified size must not be larger than
                   the desktop. If it's larger than the window size, it's
                   scaled to fit within the window.
  N%:              Similar to 'WxH' but the size is specified as a percentage
                   of the desktop size.
  relative H% V%:  The viewport is set to a 4:3 aspect ratio rectangle fit into
                   the available window/screen, then it's scaled by the H and V
                   horizontal and vertical scaling factors (valid range is from
                   20% to 300%). The resulting viewport is allowed to extend
                   beyond the window/screen. Useful to force arbitrary display
                   aspect ratios with 'aspect = stretch' and to zoom into the
                   image. This effectively emulates the horizontal and vertical
                   stretch controls of CRT monitors.
Notes:
  - Using 'relative' mode with 'integer_scaling' enabled could lead to
    surprising (but correct) results.
  - You can use the 'Stretch Axis', 'Inc Stretch', and 'Dec Stretch' hotkey
    actions to set the stretch in 'relative' mode in real-time.
.
:CONFIG_MONOCHROME_PALETTE
Set the palette for monochrome display emulation ('amber' by default).
Works only with the 'hercules' and 'cga_mono' machine types.
Note: You can also cycle through the available palettes via hotkeys.
.
:CONFIG_CGA_COLORS
Set the interpretation of CGA RGBI colours. Affects all machine types capable
of displaying CGA or better graphics. Built-in presets:
  default:       The canonical CGA palette, as emulated by VGA adapters
                 (default).
  tandy <bl>:    Emulation of an idealised Tandy monitor with adjustable brown
                 level. The brown level can be provided as an optional second
                 parameter (0 - red, 50 - brown, 100 - dark yellow;
                 defaults to 50). E.g. tandy 100
  tandy-warm:    Emulation of the actual colour output of an unknown Tandy
                 monitor.
  ibm5153 <c>:   Emulation of the actual colour output of an IBM 5153 monitor
                 with a unique contrast control that dims non-bright colours
                 only. The contrast can be optionally provided as a second
                 parameter (0 to 100; defaults to 100), e.g. ibm5153 60
  agi-amiga-v1, agi-amiga-v2, agi-amiga-v3:
                 Palettes used by the Amiga ports of Sierra AGI games.
  agi-amigaish:  A mix of EGA and Amiga colours used by the Sarien
                 AGI-interpreter.
  scumm-amiga:   Palette used by the Amiga ports of LucasArts EGA games.
  colodore:      Commodore 64 inspired colours based on the Colodore palette.
  colodore-sat:  Colodore palette with 20% more saturation.
  dga16:         A modern take on the canonical CGA palette with dialed back
                 contrast.
You can also set custom colours by specifying 16 space or comma separated
colour values, either as 3 or 6-digit hex codes (e.g. #f00 or #ff0000 for full
red), or decimal RGB triplets (e.g. (255, 0, 255) for magenta). The 16 colours
are ordered as follows:
  black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, light-grey, dark-grey,
  light-blue, light-green, light-cyan, light-red, light-magenta, yellow, white.
Their default values, shown here in 6-digit hex code format, are:
  #000000 #0000aa #00aa00 #00aaaa #aa0000 #aa00aa #aa5500 #aaaaaa
  #555555 #5555ff #55ff55 #55ffff #ff5555 #ff55ff #ffff55 #ffffff
.
:CONFIG_SCALER
Software scalers are deprecated in favour of hardware-accelerated options:
  - If you used the normal2x/3x scalers, set the desired 'windowresolution'
    or 'viewport' instead, or consider using 'integer_scaling'.
  - If you used an advanced scaler, consider one of the 'glshader'
    options instead.
.
:CONFIG_GLSHADER
Set an adaptive CRT monitor emulation shader or a regular GLSL shader in OpenGL
output modes. Adaptive CRT shader options:
  crt-auto:               A CRT shader that prioritises developer intent and
                          how people experienced the game at the time of
                          release (default). The appropriate shader variant is
                          automatically selected based the graphics standard of
                          the current video mode and the viewport size,
                          irrespective of the 'machine' setting. This means
                          that even on an emulated VGA card you'll get
                          authentic single-scanned EGA monitor emulation with
                          visible "thick scanlines" in EGA games.
  crt-auto-machine:       Similar to 'crt-auto', but this picks a fixed CRT
                          monitor appropriate for the video adapter configured
                          via the 'machine' setting. E.g., CGA and EGA games
                          will appear double-scanned on an emulated VGA
                          adapter.
  crt-auto-arcade:        Emulation of an arcade or home computer monitor less
                          sharp than a typical PC monitor with thick scanlines
                          in low-resolution modes. This fantasy option does not
                          exist in real life, but it can be a lot of fun,
                          especially with DOS ports of Amiga games.
  crt-auto-arcade-sharp:  A sharper variant of the arcade shader for those who
                          like the thick scanlines but want to retain the
                          horizontal sharpness of a typical PC monitor.
Other options include 'sharp', 'none', a shader listed using the
'--list-glshaders' command-line argument, or an absolute or relative path
to a file. In all cases, you may omit the shader's '.glsl' file extension.
.
:CONFIG_COMPOSITE
Enable composite mode on start (only for 'cga', 'pcjr', and 'tandy' machine
types; 'auto' by default). 'auto' lets the program decide.
Note: Fine-tune the settings below (i.e., 'hue') using the composite hotkeys,
      then copy the new settings from the logs into your config.
.
:CONFIG_ERA
Era of composite technology ('auto' by default).
When 'auto', PCjr uses 'new', and CGA/Tandy use 'old'.
.
:CONFIG_HUE
Hue of the RGB palette (0 by default).
For example, adjust until the sky is blue.
.
:CONFIG_SATURATION
Intensity of colors, from washed out to vivid (100 by default).
.
:CONFIG_CONTRAST
Ratio between the dark and light area (100 by default).
.
:CONFIG_BRIGHTNESS
Luminosity of the image, from dark to light (0 by default).
.
:CONFIG_CONVERGENCE
Convergence of subpixel elements, from blurry to sharp (0 by default).
.
:CONFIG_CORE
CPU core used in emulation ('auto' by default). 'auto' will switch to dynamic
if available and appropriate.
.
:CONFIG_CPUTYPE
CPU type used in emulation ('auto' by default). 'auto' is the fastest choice.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLES
Number of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate per millisecond
('auto' by default). Setting this value too high may result in sound drop-outs
and lags.
  auto:            Try to guess what a game needs. It usually works, but can
                   fail with certain games.
  fixed <number>:  Set a fixed number of cycles. This is what you usually
                   need if 'auto' fails (e.g. 'fixed 4000').
  max:             Allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to handle.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEUP
Number of cycles added with the increase cycles hotkey (10 by default).
Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage.
.
:CONFIG_CYCLEDOWN
Number of cycles subtracted with the decrease cycles hotkey (20 by default).
Setting it lower than 100 will be a percentage.
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO
Enable 3dfx Voodoo emulation (enabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO_MEMSIZE
Set the amount of video memory for 3dfx Voodoo graphics, either 4 or 12 MB.
The memory is used by the Frame Buffer Interface (FBI) and Texture Mapping Unit
(TMU) as follows:
   4: 2 MB for the FBI and one TMU with 2 MB (default).
  12: 4 MB for the FBI and two TMUs, each with 4 MB.
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO_MULTITHREADING
Use threads to improve 3dfx Voodoo performance (enabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_VOODOO_BILINEAR_FILTERING
Use bilinear filtering to emulate the 3dfx Voodoo's texture smoothing effect
(disabled by default). Only suggested if you have a fast desktop-class CPU, as
it can impact frame rates on slower systems.
.
:CONFIG_CAPTURE_DIR
Directory where the various captures are saved, such as audio, video, MIDI
and screenshot captures. ('capture' in the current working directory by
default).
.
:CONFIG_DEFAULT_IMAGE_CAPTURE_FORMATS
Set the capture format of the default screenshot action ('upscaled' by
default):
  upscaled:  The image is bilinear-sharp upscaled and the correct aspect
             ratio is maintained, depending on the 'aspect' setting. The
             vertical scaling factor is always an integer. For example,
             320x200 content is upscaled to 1600x1200 (5:6 integer scaling),
             640x480 to 1920x1440 (3:3 integer scaling), and 640x350 to
             1400x1050 (2.1875:3 scaling; fractional horizontally and
             integer vertically). The filenames of upscaled screenshots
             have no postfix (e.g. 'image0001.png').
  rendered:  The post-rendered, post-shader image shown on the screen is
             captured. The filenames of rendered screenshots end with
             '-rendered' (e.g. 'image0001-rendered.png').
  raw:       The contents of the raw framebuffer is captured (this always
             results in square pixels). The filenames of raw screenshots
             end with '-raw' (e.g. 'image0001-raw.png').
If multiple formats are specified separated by spaces, the default
screenshot action will save multiple images in the specified formats.
Keybindings for taking single screenshots in specific formats are also
available.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_CAPTURE
Set the mouse capture behaviour:
  onclick:   Capture the mouse when clicking any mouse button in the window
             (default).
  onstart:   Capture the mouse immediately on start. Might not work correctly
             on some host operating systems.
  seamless:  Let the mouse move seamlessly between the DOSBox window and the
             rest of the desktop; captures only with middle-click or hotkey.
             Seamless mouse does not work correctly with all the games.
             Windows 3.1x can be made compatible with a custom mouse driver.
  nomouse:   Hide the mouse and don't send mouse input to the game.
For touch-screen control, use 'seamless'.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_MIDDLE_RELEASE
Release the captured mouse by middle-clicking, and also capture it in
seamless mode (enabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_MULTI_DISPLAY_AWARE
Allow seamless mouse behavior and mouse pointer release to work in fullscreen
mode on systems with more than one display (enabled by default).
Note: You should disable this if it incorrectly detects multiple displays
      when only one should actually be used. This might happen if you are
      using mirrored display mode or using an AV receiver's HDMI input for
      audio-only listening.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_SENSITIVITY
Global mouse sensitivity for the horizontal and vertical axes, as a percentage
(100 by default). Values can be separated by spaces, commas, or semicolons
(i.e. 100,150). Negative values invert the axis, zero disables it.
Providing only one value sets sensitivity for both axes.
Sensitivity can be further fine-tuned per mouse interface using the internal
MOUSECTL.COM tool available on the Z drive.
.
:CONFIG_MOUSE_RAW_INPUT
Enable to bypass your operating system's mouse acceleration and sensitivity
settings (enabled by default). Works in fullscreen or when the mouse is
captured in windowed mode.
.
:CONFIG_DOS_MOUSE_DRIVER
Enable built-in DOS mouse driver (enabled by default).
Notes:
  - Disable if you intend to use original MOUSE.COM driver in emulated DOS.
  - When guest OS is booted, built-in driver gets disabled automatically.
.
:CONFIG_DOS_MOUSE_IMMEDIATE
Update mouse movement counters immediately, without waiting for interrupt
(disabled by default). May improve gameplay, especially in fast-paced games
(arcade, FPS, etc.), as for some games it effectively boosts the mouse
sampling rate to 1000 Hz, without increasing interrupt overhead.
Might cause compatibility issues. List of known incompatible games:
  - Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss
  - Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds
Please report it if you find another incompatible game so we can update this
list.
.
:CONFIG_PS2_MOUSE_MODEL
PS/2 AUX port mouse model:
  standard:      3 buttons, standard PS/2 mouse.
  intellimouse:  3 buttons + wheel, Microsoft IntelliMouse.
  explorer:      5 buttons + wheel, Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer (default).
  none:          no PS/2 mouse emulated.
.
:CONFIG_COM_MOUSE_MODEL
COM (serial) port default mouse model:
  2button:      2 buttons, Microsoft mouse.
  3button:      3 buttons, Logitech mouse;
                mostly compatible with Microsoft mouse.
  wheel:        3 buttons + wheel;
                mostly compatible with Microsoft mouse.
  msm:          3 buttons, Mouse Systems mouse;
                NOT compatible with Microsoft mouse.
  2button+msm:  Automatic choice between '2button' and 'msm'.
  3button+msm:  Automatic choice between '3button' and 'msm'.
  wheel+msm:    Automatic choice between 'wheel' and 'msm' (default).
Note: Enable COM port mice in the [serial] section.
.
:CONFIG_VMWARE_MOUSE
VMware mouse interface (enabled by default).
Fully compatible only with experimental 3rd party Windows 3.1x driver.
Note: Requires PS/2 mouse to be enabled.
.
:CONFIG_VIRTUALBOX_MOUSE
VirtualBox mouse interface (enabled by default).
Fully compatible only with 3rd party Windows 3.1x driver.
Note: Requires PS/2 mouse to be enabled.
.
:CONFIG_NOSOUND
Enable silent mode (disabled by default).
Sound is still fully emulated in silent mode, but DOSBox outputs silence.
.
:CONFIG_RATE
Mixer sample rate (48000 by default).
.
:CONFIG_BLOCKSIZE
Mixer block size in sample frames (512 by default). Larger values might help
with sound stuttering but the sound will also be more lagged.
.
:CONFIG_PREBUFFER
How many milliseconds of sound to render on top of the blocksize
(20 by default). Larger values might help with sound stuttering but the sound
will also be more lagged.
.
:CONFIG_NEGOTIATE
Let the system audio driver negotiate possibly better sample rate and blocksize
settings (enabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_COMPRESSOR
Enable the auto-leveling compressor on the master channel to prevent clipping
of the audio output:
  off:  Disable compressor.
  on:   Enable compressor (default).
.
:CONFIG_CROSSFEED
Enable crossfeed globally on all stereo channels for headphone listening:
  off:     No crossfeed (default).
  on:      Enable crossfeed (normal preset).
  light:   Light crossfeed (strength 15).
  normal:  Normal crossfeed (strength 40).
  strong:  Strong crossfeed (strength 65).
Note: You can fine-tune each channel's crossfeed strength using the MIXER.
.
:CONFIG_REVERB
Enable reverb globally to add a sense of space to the sound:
  off:     No reverb (default).
  on:      Enable reverb (medium preset).
  tiny:    Simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a room;
           specifically designed for small-speaker audio systems
           (PC Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and LPT DAC devices).
  small:   Adds a subtle sense of space; good for games that use a single
           synth channel (typically OPL) for both music and sound effects.
  medium:  Medium room preset that works well with a wide variety of games.
  large:   Large hall preset recommended for games that use separate
           channels for music and digital audio.
  huge:    A stronger variant of the large hall preset; works really well
           in some games with more atmospheric soundtracks.
Note: You can fine-tune each channel's reverb level using the MIXER.
.
:CONFIG_CHORUS
Enable chorus globally to add a sense of stereo movement to the sound:
  off:     No chorus (default).
  on:      Enable chorus (normal preset).
  light:   A light chorus effect (especially suited for synth music that
           features lots of white noise).
  normal:  Normal chorus that works well with a wide variety of games.
  strong:  An obvious and upfront chorus effect.
Note: You can fine-tune each channel's chorus level using the MIXER.
.
:CONFIG_MIDIDEVICE
Set where MIDI data from the emulated MPU-401 MIDI interface is sent
('auto' by default):
  oss:         Use the Linux OSS MIDI playback interface.
  alsa:        Use the Linux ALSA MIDI playback interface.
  fluidsynth:  The built-in FluidSynth MIDI synthesizer (SoundFont player).
               See the [fluidsynth] section for detailed configuration.
  mt32:        The built-in Roland MT-32 synthesizer.
               See the [mt32] section for detailed configuration.
  auto:        Either one of the built-in MIDI synthesisers (if `midiconfig` is
               set to 'fluidsynth' or 'mt32'), or a MIDI device external to
               DOSBox (any other 'midiconfig' value). This might be a software
               synthesizer or physical device. This is the default behaviour.
  none:        Disable MIDI output.
.
:CONFIG_MIDICONFIG
Configuration options for the selected MIDI interface (unset by default).
This is usually the ID or name of the MIDI synthesizer you want
to use (find the ID/name with the DOS command 'MIXER /LISTMIDI').
Notes:
  - This option has no effect when using the built-in synthesizers
    ('mididevice = fluidsynth' or 'mididevice = mt32').
  - When using ALSA, use the Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list all open
    MIDI ports and select one (e.g. 'midiconfig = 14:0' for sequencer
    client 14, port 0).
  - If you're using a physical Roland MT-32 with revision 0 PCB, the hardware
    may require a delay in order to prevent its buffer from overflowing.
    In that case, add 'delaysysex' (e.g. 'midiconfig = 2 delaysysex').
.
:CONFIG_MPU401
MPU-401 mode to emulate ('intelligent' by default).
.
:CONFIG_RAW_MIDI_OUTPUT
Enable raw, unaltered MIDI output (disabled by default).
The MIDI drivers of many games don't fully conform to the MIDI standard,
which makes editing the MIDI recordings of these games very error-prone and
cumbersome in MIDI sequencers, often resulting in hanging or missing notes.
DOSBox corrects the MIDI output of such games by default. This results in no
audible difference whatsoever; it only affects the representation of the MIDI
data. You should only enable 'raw_midi_output' if you really need to capture
the raw, unaltered MIDI output of a program, e.g. when working with music
applications, or when debugging MIDI issues.
.
:CONFIG_SOUNDFONT
Path to a SoundFont file in .sf2 format ('default.sf2' by default).
You can use an absolute or relative path, or the name of an .sf2 inside the
'soundfonts' directory within your DOSBox configuration directory.
An optional percentage value after the name will scale the SoundFont's volume.
This is useful for normalising the volume of different SoundFonts.
E.g. 'my_soundfont.sf2 50' will attenuate the volume by 50%.
The percentage value can range from 1 to 800.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_CHORUS
Chorus effect: 'auto' (default), 'on', 'off', or custom values.
When using custom values:
  All five must be provided in-order and space-separated.
  They are: voice-count level speed depth modulation-wave, where:
    - voice-count is an integer from 0 to 99
    - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 10.0
    - speed is a decimal, measured in Hz, from 0.1 to 5.0
    - depth is a decimal from 0.0 to 21.0
    - modulation-wave is either 'sine' or 'triangle'
  For example: chorus = 3 1.2 0.3 8.0 sine
Note: You can disable the FluidSynth chorus and enable the mixer-level chorus
      on the FluidSynth channel instead, or enable both chorus effects at the
      same time. Whether this sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the
      chorus settings being used.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_REVERB
Reverb effect: 'auto' (default), 'on', 'off', or custom values.
When using custom values:
  All four must be provided in-order and space-separated.
  They are: room-size damping width level, where:
    - room-size is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
    - damping is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
    - width is a decimal from 0.0 to 100.0
    - level is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0
  For example: reverb = 0.61 0.23 0.76 0.56
Note: You can disable the FluidSynth reverb and enable the mixer-level reverb
      on the FluidSynth channel instead, or enable both reverb effects at the
      same time. Whether this sounds good depends on the SoundFont and the
      reverb settings being used.
.
:CONFIG_FSYNTH_FILTER
Filter for the FluidSynth audio output:
  off:       Don't filter the output (default).
  <custom>:  Custom filter definition; see 'sb_filter' for details.
.
:CONFIG_MODEL
The Roland MT-32/CM-32ML model to use.
You must have the ROM files for the selected model available (see 'romdir').
The lookup order for models that don't specify a version in their name is
performed in order as listed.
  auto:       Pick the first available model (default).
  cm32l:      Pick the first available CM-32L model.
  mt32_old:   Pick the first available "old" MT-32 model (v1.0x).
  mt32_new:   Pick the first available "new" MT-32 model (v2.0x).
  mt32:       Pick the first available MT-32 model.
  <version>:  Use the exact specified model version (e.g., 'mt32_204').
.
:CONFIG_ROMDIR
The directory containing the Roland MT-32/CM-32ML ROMs (unset by default).
The directory can be absolute or relative, or leave it unset to use the

  off:       Don't fade out; residual output will play forever (default).
  on:        Wait 0.5s before fading out over a 0.5s period.
  <custom>:  A custom fade-out definition in the following format:
               WAIT FADE
             Where WAIT is how long after the last IO port write fading begins,
             ranging between 100 and 5000 milliseconds; and FADE is the
             fade-out period, ranging between 10 and 3000 milliseconds.
             Examples:
                300 200 (Wait 300ms before fading out over a 200ms period)

             Use the filter of this Sound Blaster model.
  modern:    Use linear interpolation upsampling that acts as a low-pass
             filter; this is the legacy DOSBox behaviour (default).
  off:       Don't filter the output.
  <custom>:  One or two custom filters in the following format:
               TYPE ORDER FREQ
             Where TYPE can be 'hpf' (high-pass) or 'lpf' (low-pass),
             ORDER is the order of the filter from 1 to 16
             (1st order = 6dB/oct slope, 2nd order = 12dB/oct, etc.),

compatibility but certain applications may run better with other choices,
or require EMS support to be disabled to work at all.
.
:CONFIG_UMB
Enable UMB support (enabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_VER
Set DOS version (5.0 by default). Specify in major.minor format.
A single number is treated as the major version.
Common settings are 3.3, 5.0, 6.22, and 7.1.
.
:CONFIG_LOCALE_PERIOD
Set locale epoch ('modern' by default). Historic settings (if available
for the given country) try to mimic old DOS behaviour when displaying
information such as dates, time, or numbers, modern ones follow current day
practices for user experience more consistent with typical host systems.
.
:CONFIG_COUNTRY
Set DOS country code ('auto' by default).
This affects country-specific information such as date, time, and decimal
formats. The list of supported country codes can be displayed using
'--list-countries' command-line argument. If set to 'auto', the country code
corresponding to the selected keyboard layout will be used.
.
:CONFIG_KEYBOARDLAYOUT
Language code of the keyboard layout, or 'auto' ('auto' by default).
.
:CONFIG_EXPAND_SHELL_VARIABLE
Enable expanding environment variables such as %PATH% in the DOS command shell
(auto by default, enabled if DOS version >= 7.0).
FreeDOS and MS-DOS 7/8 COMMAND.COM supports this behavior.
.
:CONFIG_SHELL_HISTORY_FILE
File containing persistent command line history ('shell_history.txt'
by default). Setting it to empty disables persistent shell history.
.
:CONFIG_SETVER_TABLE_FILE
File containing the list of applications and assigned DOS versions, in a
tab-separated format, used by SETVER.EXE as a persistent storage
(empty by default).
.
:CONFIG_IPX
Enable IPX over UDP/IP emulation (enabled by default).
.
:CONFIG_NE2000
Enable emulation of a Novell NE2000 network card on a software-based
network (using libslirp) with properties as follows (enabled by default):
  - 255.255.255.0:  Subnet mask of the 10.0.2.0 virtual LAN.
  - 10.0.2.2:       IP of the gateway and DHCP service.
  - 10.0.2.3:       IP of the virtual DNS server.
  - 10.0.2.15:      First IP provided by DHCP, your IP!
Note: Inside DOS, setting this up requires an NE2000 packet driver, DHCP
      client, and TCP/IP stack. You might need port-forwarding from the host
      into the DOS guest, and from your router to your host when acting as the
      server for multiplayer games.
.
:CONFIG_NICBASE
Base address of the NE2000 card (300 by default).
Note: Addresses 220 and 240 might not be available as they're assigned to the
      Sound Blaster and Gravis UltraSound by default.
.
:CONFIG_NICIRQ
The interrupt used by the NE2000 card (3 by default).
Note: IRQs 3 and 5 might not be available as they're assigned to
      'serial2' and the Gravis UltraSound by default.
.
:CONFIG_MACADDR
The MAC address of the NE2000 card ('AC:DE:48:88:99:AA' by default).
.
:CONFIG_TCP_PORT_FORWARDS
Forward one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest
(unset by default).
The format is:
  port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
  This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
  host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
  This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest.
A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
  start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
  This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
  hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
  This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest.
Notes:
  - If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
  - If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
  - If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
.
:CONFIG_UDP_PORT_FORWARDS
Forward one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest
(unset by default). The format is the same as for TCP port forwards.
.

:PROGRAM_AUTOTYPE_HELP_LONG
Perform scripted keyboard entry into a running DOS game.

Usage:
  [color=light-green]autotype[reset] -list
  [color=light-green]autotype[reset] [-w [color=white]WAIT[reset]] [-p [color=white]PACE[reset]] [color=light-cyan]BUTTONS[reset]

Parameters:
  [color=white]WAIT[reset]     number of seconds to wait before typing begins (max of 30)
  [color=white]PACE[reset]     number of seconds before each keystroke (max of 10)
  [color=light-cyan]BUTTONS[reset]  one or more space-separated buttons

Notes:
  The [color=light-cyan]BUTTONS[reset] supplied in the command will be autotyped into running DOS games
  after they start. Autotyping begins after [color=light-cyan]WAIT[reset] seconds, and each button is
  entered every [color=white]PACE[reset] seconds. The [color=light-cyan],[reset] character inserts an extra [color=white]PACE[reset] delay.
  [color=white]WAIT[reset] and [color=white]PACE[reset] default to 2 and 0.5 seconds respectively if not specified.
  A list of all available button names can be obtained using the -list option.

Examples:
  [color=light-green]autotype[reset] -list
  [color=light-green]autotype[reset] -w [color=white]1[reset] -p [color=white]0.3[reset] [color=light-cyan]up enter , right enter[reset]

:PROGRAM_INTRO_CDROM_WINDOWS
[erases=entire][color=light-green]How to mount a real/virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox:[reset]
DOSBox provides CD-ROM emulation on two levels.

The [color=brown]basic[reset] level works on all normal directories, which installs MSCDEX
and marks the files read-only. Usually this is enough for most games:
[color=light-blue]mount D C:\example -t cdrom[reset]
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:
[color=light-blue]mount D C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[reset]

The [color=brown]next[reset] level adds some low-level support.
Therefore only works on CD-ROM drives:
[color=light-blue]mount d[reset] [color=red]D:\ [color=light-blue]-t cdrom -usecd [color=yellow]0[reset]
Replace [color=red]D:\ [reset]with the location of your CD-ROM.
Replace the [color=yellow]0[reset] in [color=light-blue]-usecd [color=yellow]0[reset] with the number reported for your CD-ROM if you type:
[color=light-blue]mount -listcd[reset]

Additionally, you can use imgmount to mount ISO or CUE/BIN images:
[color=light-blue]imgmount D C:\cd.iso -t cdrom[reset]
[color=light-blue]imgmount D C:\cd.cue -t cdrom[reset]

  - Run [color=light-green]mixer[reset] without arguments to view the current settings.
  - Run [color=light-green]mixer[reset] /listmidi to list all available MIDI devices.
  - You may change the settings of more than one channel in a single command.
  - If no channel is specified, you can set crossfeed, reverb, or chorus
    of all channels globally.
  - The /noshow option applies the changes without showing the mixer settings.
