                       Copyright (C) 2017 Mateusz Viste

bsum is a tiny (256 bytes) tool that can compute the BSD checksum of any file.
It requires only a few kilobytes of memory, and is fast even on an 8086-class
PC. bsum supports files of any size, as long as your file system can cope with
them. The BSD checksum is displayed in hexadecimal format, like "C2E1". bsum
is designed for verifying data integrity on systems that are very constrained
in terms of disk space, memory or CPU power. bsum is typically used to verify
that files transferred by unreliable means arrived intact.
