       =========


       Resident program that enables assigning short aliases to long
       commands. This is a program I wrote a long time ago. I have since
       long wanted to rewrite it from scratch, removing all the annoying
       limitations, but it seems that I never get the time. Therefore I
       just translated it to English, so that you DOSED-users can have at
       least _some_ kind of aliases.

       The program will occupy about 2 kb of memory, of wich 1 kb is for
       the aliases.

       NOTE: You must load DOSED _before_ ALIAS, else ALIAS won't work.
             DOSED will never pass the line further, of natural causes.

       Note that I won't extend this program, so it won't help to send
       suggestions. I have plenty ideas for a new version, and I hope to
       be able to make it sometime.

       Type ALIAS ? for a short explanation. Here's a list of some of the
       limitations:

       * Aliases won't work in batch-files, only when a line is read using
         INT 21h, func 0Ah - as COMMAND.COM does when fetching commands
         from the user (you!).

       * Only the first word of a line will be expanded. This means that
         you can't alias a filter command like MORE. (TYPE foo | MORE).

       * Circular aliases will hang the system!

       * Only letters (A-Z) allowed in aliasnames.

       * No uninstall.

       * No user-specified buffer-size.

       * No initfile with list of aliases.

       * And most important: No positional parameters. ALIAS will just
         replace the first word with whatever the alias is.


       I have a file called ALIAS.BAT that is run from AUTOEXEC.BAT using:

           CALL \BAT\ALIAS.BAT

       Here's some example lines from that ALIAS.BAT of mine:

           lh alias cc  bcc -mt -lt -f- -O2 -G -Z -vi
           alias dur    dir
           alias la     xd -h -wnesdta
           alias ll     xd
           alias ls     xd -wF -s- -t- -f-
           alias m      c:\borlandc\bin\make
           alias qfa    format a: /q /u /v:""
           alias tidy   rm -rv \*.bak \*.~*
           alias sync   smartdrv /c

       Note that the first ALIAS has LH in front of it, to load it high.
       Only the first call makes a resident program, so only the first
       needs LH.

       XD is my directory lister, RM is my Unix-like rm (see OTHERPRG.TXT).

       And as you can see, ALIAS is nice for spelling errors :-)


       Finally: _I_ live a happy life with this program, in spite of it's
       many limitations, maybe you can too... :-)
