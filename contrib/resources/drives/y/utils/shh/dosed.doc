       Starting DOSED
       --------------

       (Make sure you don't have any other commandline editing programs
       (DOSKEY, for instance) installed. None of these cooperate...)

       DOSED can be started with or without parameters. If no parameters
       are given, the program is activated with default values, which are
       the `opposite' of the options below.

       The following options are recognised:

           -b     Beep when filename is incomplete. This causes DOSED to
                  sound the internal speaker when it is not able to fully
                  complete a filename, or when there is no match at all.

           -d     Disable appending '\' to directory names. No character at
                  all is appended.

           -e     Use Emacs-like control keys. Be aware that since ^P has
                  a special meaning in Emacs, it is no longer possible to
                  use this key for printer echo!

           -i     Make 'Insert on' default.

           -l     Use lowercase letters in completed filenames. It is
                  actually MS-DOS that causes uppercase letters when file-
                  names are completed. Giving the -l option forces DOSED to
                  convert the characters returned from MS-DOS to lowercase.

           -m     Minimum number of character on stored lines. Lines
                  shorter than the given limit, will not be stored in the
                  history buffer. Default: -m3

           -off   Temporarily disable the program. Enable with DOSED. Note
                  that the program is not removed from memory using this
                  option. To remove it, use -u.

           -q     Quiet. Supress settings messages. This option is for use
                  in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

           -r-    Turn off automatic removal of trailing backslashes. (See
                  special section below!)

           -s-    Don't skip .BAK-files when completing filenames.

           -u     Uninstall if possible. No later TSR must have hooked the
                  vector for INT 21h.

       To disable a selected option, append (or remove) a `-' after the
       option character. If you have for instance selected the beep but got
       tired of it, type

           DOSED -b-

       to turn it off again. My favourite options at the moment are:

           DOSED -q -e -i -b -l -m1

       This makes DOSED a bit like GNU bash (and other shells) for Unix.



       Editing
       -------

       With DOSED it is possible to edit the current commandline using the
       cursor keys, or a subset of WordStar or Emacs control keys. The
       `special keys' are always available. The control keys are either
       WordStar or Emacs, depending on command line options.
       Here's a list of the keys and their meanings:

           Special keys| WordStar | Emacs | Meaning
           ------------+----------+-------+-------------------------------
           Left arrow  |    ^S    |  ^B   | Move character left
           Right arrow |    ^D    |  ^F   | Move character right
           Ctrl-left   |    ^A    |       | Move word left
           Ctrl-right  |    ^F    |       | Move word right
           Home        |          |  ^A   | Move to beginning of line
           End         |          |  ^E   | Move to end of line
           Ins         |    ^V    |       | Toggle insert mode
           Del         |    ^G    |  ^D   | Delete character under cursor
           BackSpace   |    ^H    |  ^H   | Delete character left of cursor
           Esc         |    ^Y    |  ^U   | Clear line
           Ctrl-End    |    ^Q    |  ^K   | Clear to end of line

       Note that ^Q is a short for the `real' WordStar ^QY.

       When insertmode is default (on or off, specified by the -i -switch),
       the cursor is a normal underline. When toggled to not default, the
       cursor is turned into a block.



       History
       -------

       Previous commands can be recalled using the following keys:

           Special keys| WordStar | Emacs | Meaning
           ------------+----------+-------+-------------------------------
           Up arrow/F3 |    ^E    |  ^P   | Recall previous command
           Down arrow  |    ^X    |  ^N   | Recall `next' command in the
                       |          |       | circular buffer.
           F1          |          |       | Recall previous command and
                       |          |       | move to beginning of the line.

       The historybuffer is a circular buffer of 512 bytes, in which all
       commands longer than 2 characters are stored. The 2 character limit
       can be overridden using a program option (see below).



       Filename completion
       -------------------

       The following keys are available for filename completion:

           Special keys| WordStar | Emacs | Meaning
           ------------+----------+-------+-------------------------------
           Tab         |    ^I    |  ^I   | Complete filename
           Shift-Tab   |    ^Z    |  ^Z   | Display matching filenames
           Tab Tab     |          |       |          --- " ---

       When pressing Tab or Ctrl-I, DOSED will try to complete the filename
       immediately to the left of the cursor. As an example, assume you
       want to look at a file called README.TXT. (The underline character
       symbolises the cursor, and should not be typed in.) You write

           TYPE R_

       an press Tab just after the R. If no more files starts with an R,
       DOSED completes the filename and gives you the line

           TYPE README.TXT _

       A blank is added after the filename, to let you enter more
       parameters.

       Now assume there was a file called RESTORE.COM in the same directory.
       DOSED wouldn't know whether you wanted README.TXT or RESTORE.COM
       since both starts with an R, so it completes as much as possible:

           TYPE RE_

       No blank is added, since the filename isn't complete. To get
       README.TXT, you should type an A, and press Tab again.

           TYPE REA_

       This time DOSED knows the only file starting with REA is README.TXT,
       and fully completes the filename.

           TYPE README.TXT _

       If the file you want happens to be a directory, DOSED appends a
       backslash (\) assuming you will enter a more accurate path. As an
       example, assume our file README.TXT is in a directory called \TOOLS,
       and that no other directories starts with a T. You write

           TYPE \T_

       and press Tab. DOSED completes to

           TYPE \TOOLS\_

       Now you type an R, and press Tab again:

           TYPE \TOOLS\R_

       and DOSED faithfully completes the line to

           TYPE \TOOLS\README.TXT _

       (assuming no other file in \TOOLS starts with an R.) The backslash
       appending might be turned off using a program option. (Please see
       the "Trailing backslash removal"-section below!).

       Note that DOSED assumes that you are never interested in .BAK-files,
       so it will not complete those files.

       When DOSED is unable to fully complete the filename, it might be
       interresting to know what matching names are available. Pressing
       Shift-Tab, ^Z or a second Tab will give a list of matching names.
       This might also be used as a very simple DIR-command. Note that if
       no name is partly specified, all names match. That is: If the
       character before the cursor is a blank, or the cursor is at the
       start of the line when Shift-Tab is pressed, a list of all files in
       the current directory is given.



       Trailing backslash removal
       --------------------------

       Most DOS-commands won't handle directorynames with a trailing back-
       slash. As an example,

           DIR \DOS\

       will complain about an "Unknown directory". This is a real nuisance
       with filename completion, since it (as default) adds a backslash to
       any directory.

       DOSED removes all backslashes at the end of words before passing the
       command line to DOS. This _might_ give you some trouble if you use
       programs that need this backslash (some archivers do). When you are
       aware of it, you can solve the problem in one of these ways:

           * Turn off the backslash removal using the -r- option.
           * Add a second backlash. DOSED will only remove one.
           * Start the entire commandline with a space character. In this
             case DOSED will leave it unchanged.

       Note that you won't see that the backslash is removed, it's done
       internally. To see the actual line, try something like

           ECHO DIR \DOS\



       Attention
       ---------

       Be aware of the following:

           * DOSED won't cooperate with other, similar programs, like
             DOSKEY (Microsoft MS-DOS v6.xx). You'll have to choose _one_.

           * Control-characters are no longer displayed as ^X, but rather
             as the matching character in IBM's ASCII-table.

           * The normal commandline editing using the functionkeys are no
             longer supported.

           * DOSED will only work when the keyboard is read using INT 21h,
             function 0Ah. This is the methode used by COMMAND.COM.
             Other shell-programs probably use their own inputroutines,
             causing DOSED to be inactive.

           * If DOSED can't recognise the current screen mode as text mode,
             it simply passes control to the good (?) old editing routine.

           * DOSED might cause problems when used with other programs that
             reprogram INT 21h, function 0Ah. Try starting them in a
             different order, and see if that works better.
             As a rule of thumb: DOSED should be started first, since it
             won't give control to any earlier programs!

           * The environment-block is freed to save memory. This can make
             it hard for memory mapping programs to find the name of DOSED.

           * As noted above, printer echo is disabled when Emacs-mode is
             used, since ^P has a special meaning in Emacs.

           * When using DOSED in Windows 3.1 DOS-boxes, you should add
             DOSED to the localtsrs-line in the [NonWindowsApp] section
             of your SYSTEM.INI-file.

           * If you haven't already done so, please read the "Trailing
             backslash removal"-section above.

           * For some reason, redefinition of keys using ANSI.SYS won't
             work with DOSED.



       Finally
       -------

       Thanks for reading this far. Unfortunately the size of this file
       increases as I add more features to the program. I hate long docs!

       If you decide to use this program, thanks! I would be happy hearing
       from you if you find any bugs, have any suggestions, or just to know
       that one more person uses my program.

       And... please ignore my poor English. Hope you understand anyway!



                                                   Sverre.
