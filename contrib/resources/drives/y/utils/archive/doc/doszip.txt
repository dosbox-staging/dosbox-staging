<> Doszip Commander File List

    DZBIN???.ZIP: Program files

    DZ.EXE	- DZ Loader (DOS) / DZ Main Shell (Win32)
    DZ.DOS	- DZ Main Shell (DOS)
    DOSZIP.TXT  - DZ Help file (this file)
    LICENSE.TXT - GNU General Public License

    DZSRC???.ZIP: Source code

    INC		- Library header files
    LIB		- Library files are created here
    SRC		- The source files are contained here
    HISTORY.TXT - Changelog file for Doszip

    The first time you run DZ.EXE, it creates a default configuration
    directory (.\doc). Configuration files will be located there.

    The version of the source code and binary files is the date and
    time in the .ZIP file (1:00 == v1.00)

    The date format is (Norwegian) dd.mm.yyyy


<> Memory Requirements (DOS)

    Doszip Commander needs at least 200K conventional memory in order
    to run all its internal viewers.

    The [Panel Filter] of each panel controles the global memory usage
    in the [Read count] section.

    The Doszip Commander comes with two additional memory configurations
    that can be selected from the command line. Each memory configuration
    limits the number of files that can be stored in each Commander File
    Panel. The command line syntax of these memory configurations are:

      /T	Launch Commander with TINY memory configuration.
		Number of files per panel is 500.
      /L	Launch Commander with  LARGE memory configuration.
		Number of files per panel is 5000.


<> Command Line

    Command	Description
    ---------	-----------------------------------------------------
    /C<path>	Set Configuration PATH to <path>
    /N<count>	Maximum number of files in each panel
		Default is 5000 in Win32 and 3000 in DOS.

      DZ <filename> command starts DZ and forces it to show <filename>
    contents if it is an archive or show folder contents if <filename>
    is a folder.


<> Compressed File Support

    Password protected Compressed files
    -----------------------------------
    While the Doszip Commander Compression Engine is compatible with
    PKZIP 1.x and PKZIP 2.x compress file formats, Commander only
    allows a single password for each compressed file to be active.
    The internal compression configuration is set by Ctrl-J


<> Viewer Support

    All viewers are defined in the file DZ.INI. You can modify the [View]
    section of DZ.INI file to associated 4 viewers:

    [View]
    F3	  = ; You can override the internal viewer by redefine F3
    Alt	  = ; Viewer for Alt+F3
    Ctrl  = ; Viewer for Ctrl+F3
    Shift = ; Viewer for Shift+F3

    Internal Viewer
    ---------------
    To launch the internal viewer contained within DZ.DLL,
    type F3 (= Macro %VIEW%).


<> Editor Support

    All editors are defined in the file DZ.INI. You can modify the [Edit]
    section of DZ.INI file to associated 4 editors:

    [Edit]
    F4	  = ; You can override the internal editor by redefine F4
    Alt	  = ; Editor for Alt+F4
    Ctrl  = ; Editor for Ctrl+F4
    Shift = ; Editor for Shift+F4

<> Internal Editor

    To launch the internal editor contained within DZ.DLL,
    type F4 (= Macro %EDIT%).

    External comands
    ----------------

    You can modify the [ShiftF1..F9], and [AltF1..F6] sections of the DZ.INI
    file to associate external comands: (excluding Alt-F3)

    [ShiftF3]
    asm  = JWasm -I%doszip%\inc
    c	 = wcc -ml

    The syntax is equal to the section [Filetype].

    The sections [Shift/Alt-FX] parse a ".err" file if exist:

     Alt-F7 Prev error
     Alt-F8 Next error

    Syntax highlighting
    -------------------

    Style codes:

    1. Attrib	A - Set background and forground color
    2. Control  O - Set color of CONTROL characters
    3. Quote	Q - Set color of quoted text
    4. Digit	D - Set color of numbers
    5. Char	C - Set color of chars
    6. String	S - Set color of string
    7. Begin	B - Set color from start of string
    8. Word	W - Set color of words
    9. Nested	N - Set color of nested strings

    The code have the following syntax:

    [<name>]
    00 = <attrib>[ <string>][ <string2>]...
    01 = ...

    Attrib: Color and character, or color (default is space (20h))
    00=A 07 FA

    Control: Color
    00=O 4X

    Quote: Color
    00=Q XB

    Digit: Color
    00=D XB

    Char: Color and char(s)
    00=C XF $%()

    String: Color and string
    00=S 4X Error

    Begin: Color and string(s)
    00=B X6 # include

    Word: Color and word(s)
    00=W X4 ax bx cx dx al bl cl dl
    01=ds es cs ss

    Nested: Color, string1 and string2
    00=N X8 /* */

    File type definition
    --------------------

    Code for syntax is located in [.\doc\style] directory, and file types
    must be defined under the section [Style] in the DZ.INI file:

    [Style]
    asm = asm.ini
    inc = asm.ini

    .ASM and .INC files will now use the file .\doc\style\asm.ini

    The editor reads the section [.] in the code file which have the
    following syntax:

    [.]
    <Id>=<section>
    [<section>]
    <code>


<> Extension and Filename Support

    Defining Filetypes
    ------------------
    You can modify the [Filetype] section to associated files in the format
    as follows:

    <ext>  = <command> !.! - filetype
    <name> = <command>	  - filename (no ext)

    File macros:

    !!	    !
    !:	    Drive + ':'
    !\	    Long path
    !	    Long file name
    .!	    Long extension
    !~\	    Short path
    ~!	    Short file name

    Default (no macro used):

    'Long_Name.foo' --> '<command> Long_Name.foo'
    'Long Name.foo' --> '<command> "Long Name.foo"'

    Quotations are not added if macros are used:

    - Short: txt=edit ~!.!~
    - Long:  txt=notepad "!:!\\!.!"

    Multiple commands are parsed to a batch file. Use the ", " to separate
    the commands.

    Example: README.TXT

    [Filetype]
    TXT=echo !, echo .!, echo !.!

    Expands to a batch file:

    @echo off
    echo README
    echo .TXT
    echo README.TXT


<> Doszip Commander Environment Variables

    Doszip searches your environment for the following environment
    variables: COMSPEC, PATH, TEMP and DZ.

    The %DZ% variable may be used on the command line or in the .INI file.
    It is the path on your hard disk where the documents and configuration
    files are stored. The %DOSZIP% variable is the path where the commander
    is located.

    The value of %DZ% may be set in the environment (SET DZ=<path>), or on
    the command line (/C<path>). Command line overwrites environment.
    The default value is equal to %DOSZIP%.

    The variable COMSPEC will be overwritten by the [Comspec] value if
    defined:

    [Comspec]
    00=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CMD.EXE
    01=/C

    This will force Doszip to use CMD.EXE insted of COMMAND.COM
    To define a single-line program, just exclude the 01= value:

    [Comspec]
    00=D:\CYGWIN\BIN\BASH.EXE


<> Windows 95/98/XP Compatibility

    Doszip uses the 'Windows95 LONG FILENAME' functions if available.

    Doszip uses the 'WINOLDAP' functions if available. This enables
    clipboard functions to Copy and Paste text from Windows.

    NTCMDPROMPT
    -----------
    To use the NT command prompt (Cmd.exe) as discribed in the CONFIG.NT
    file, the [Comspec] value should be set in the DZ.INI file.


<> Installing Commander under Windows

    Right click your desktop, select New->Shortcut.
    Type in the full path name of the DZ.EXE file, e.g. C:\DZ\DZ.EXE,
    or use the browse button if you are not sure of the path.

    Select the OK button.

    The Doszip Commander is now installed on your desktop.


<> Creating a tools menu

    It is possible to add a user defined Tools Menu to the Doszip
    Commander's main menu.

    All Tool-items are defined in the file DZ.INI. You can modify the
    [Tools] section of DZ.INI to associated 20 Tool-items: [00..19]

    To define a Menu item use the following format:

    XX = <> ; Insert a line
    XX = Menu_Item_Name, Command_to_be_invoked_when_selected
    XX = Menu_Item_Name, [Menu_to_be_invoked_when_selected]

    Macros that can be used in 'Command' expand as follows:

    %EDIT%  [Edit] --> F4=<> | Internal editor
    %VIEW%  [View] --> F3=<> | Internal viewer
    %FIND%  Internal File Search(command)

    These must be the first command on the line.
    The macro %DOSZIP% and %DZ% may appear any place in the command line.

    You can insert commands into a sub-menu in the same way described above.

    For example a simple Tools Menu may look like:

    [Tools]
    00 = &Add tool,%EDIT% %DZ%\DZ.INI
    01 = <>
    02 = &Doszip directory,[Doszip]

    [Doszip]
    00 = Doszip &Command Line, %DOSZIP%\DZ.EXE -?
    01 = View &DZ.INI, %VIEW% %DZ%\DZ.INI
    02 = View &DOSZIP.TXT, %VIEW% %DZ%\DOSZIP.TXT
    03 = Search &Source Directory, %FIND% %DOSZIP%\src\*.*
    04 = Search &Include Directory, %FIND% %DOSZIP%\inc\*.*
    05 = <>
    06 = &Previous Menu..,[Tools]


<> The File Search utility

    The File Search utility use the short keys Ctrl-S or Shift-Tab, but
    from the command line or configuration file you can use the macro:

    %find% <directory> <file_mask(s)> <text_to_find_in_files>

    Example: %find% %doszip% *.h *.inc *.c *.asm ?

    Shortkeys
    ---------
    F2	 - Save result to list file.
    F3	 - View current file - same as Enter.
    F4	 - Edit current file - exit and execute external editor.
    F5	 - Launch the Operation Filter dialog.
    F6	 - Toggle ascii/hex search string.
    F7	 - Start a new search.
    F8	 - Delete  Delete file from list.
    F9	 - Load predefined file mask from .INI file.
    F10  - Toggle output format
    Esc  - Exit program.


<> Create List File

    The Create List File utility use the short key Alt-L, or drag and drop
    selected files to the command line. Use F2 in File Search to save list.

    Output format string:

    \\	   \
    \%	   %
    \t	   09
    \n	   0D 0A
    %id	   Index

    %ext   .asm
    %n	   cmmklist
    %p	   /doszip/src/dzmain
    %f	   /doszip/src/dzmain/cmmklist.asm

    %s	   Search string
    %o	   Offset from File Search
    %cd	   Current directory
    %dz	   Doszip directory


<> Operation Filter

    Choosing the Filters button (available on many of the file operation
    panels - such as copy or move) displays the Operation Filters dialog box.

    The filters allow the users to specify file selection based on file name,
    date, size and attributes. The definitions for the Operation Filters used
    are stored in the DZ.CFG file.

    You can modify the [Filter] section of DZ.INI file to add pre-defined
    filters for use in commonly performed searches.

    Use F3 to load pre-defined filters to [Include] and [Exlcude].
    Use F4 to load date from the calendar to [File date].
