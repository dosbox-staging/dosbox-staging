This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle
works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem
with an ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to
help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an
ASP member, but does not provide technical support for members' products.
Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Rd., Muskegon, MI USA, or
send a Compuserve message via CIS MAIL to ASP Ombudsman 72050,1433.
