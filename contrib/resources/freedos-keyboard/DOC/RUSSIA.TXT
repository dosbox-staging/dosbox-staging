Support for official languages in Russia
========================================

According to information collected on the web, there are 31 official
languages in Russia where russian is nationwide and the other 30 are:

Adyghe      Chuvash     Kalmyk             Komi-Zyrian     Ossetian
Altai       Dolgan      Karachay-Balkar    Koryak          Tatar
Bashkir     Erzya       Karelian           Mansi           Tuvin
Buryat      Evenki      Khakas             Mari            Udmurt
Chechen     Ingush      Khanty             Moksha          Yakut
Chukchi     Kabardian   Komi-Permyak       Nenets          Yiddish

Russian is already assisted through regular major industry codepages
(cp866 and cp808) and Yiddish was left unassisted for the time being
because KEYB can't handle right-to-left scripts yet.

This document focus on the other 29 languages. I have made codepages
to handle them, as well as keyboard layouts; in  order  to  avoid  a
a large number of both of them, I have gathered characters according
to the region where they are required.

For all keyboard layouts:

<Alt> + <Left_Shift> selects the latin layer (default);
<Alt> + <Right_Shift> selects the cyrillic layer.

All codepages are based on cp808/cp866, so they can be used to write
and/or read the russian  language;  the  extra  characters  replaced
linedraw and/or block characters. The Numero and the Euro signs were
also left on the same place where they're found on cp808.

The Euro sign can be found either on <AltGr> + <E> or  <AltGr> + <4>
(latin  layer)   or   on  <AltGr> + <cyrillic YE>  or  <AltGr> + <4>
(cyrillic layer) on all keyboard layouts.

There are particular mixed cyrillic/latin codepages for chechen  and
tatar; when using them, the cyrillic layer will still be available -
to type in russian only.


Tatar
-----

Codepage 30018 handles the latin tatar alphabet.
Keyboard layout: "TT".

   The following keys work as:

   Combining <AltGr> and <Shift> + <AltGr> with:
   <6> = a/A with circumflex
   <U> = u/U with diaeresis
   <I> = undotted i
   <O> = o/O with diaeresis
   <A> = a/A with diaeresis
   <S> = s/S with cedilla
   <G> = g/G with breve
   <C> = c/C with cedilla
   <N> = n/N with tilde

   <'> works as deadkey for <A, E, I, O, U>.

Codepage 30013 handles the cyrillic tatar alphabet.

   The cyrillic layer follows Windows XP standards.


Chechen
-------

Codepage 30019 handles the latin chechen alphabet.
Keyboard layout: "CE".

  The following keys work as:

  Combining <AltGr> and <Shift> + <AltGr> with:

  <Q, G, X, C> = q/Q, g/G, x/X, c/C with dot above
  <Z> = z/Z with stroke
  <O> = uo/UO ligature
  <E> = ie/IE ligature
  <A> = schwa/SCHWA
  <S> = s/S with cedilla
  <N> = n/N with hook
  <[> = c/C with cedilla
  <]> = c/C with cedilla and dot above

  Diaeresis: <`> works as deadkey for <A, O, U>

Codepage 30011 handles the cyrillic chechen alphabet.

  Standard russian keyboard:
  <=> = palochka; <AltGr> + <=> = "="

  Russian typewriter (/id: 443) keyboard:
  <|> = palochka; <AltGr> + <|> = "|"

  All the rest is the same as the cyrillic layer of russian keyboards.

The other 27 languages are assisted through keyboard layout "RX" and 7
different codepages.
