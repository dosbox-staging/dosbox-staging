## :fontawesome-solid-bug: Report an issue

bugs. If you think you've spotted one, please report it in our [issue
tracker](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/issues) (requires a

The [DOSBox Staging Wiki][wiki] hosted on GitHub contains lots of useful
tricks & tips, how-to's, lists, and guides that can help newcomers and more
experienced users alike.

We very much recommend perusing it, and if you've spotted an
error or have something to share, please feel free to contribute to it.

## :material-piggy-bank-outline: Make a donation

**DOSBox Staging** is an entirely volunteer-based effort---we're
not getting paid for our activities. However, we have some running
expenses and need to invest in hardware, licenses, and other non-trivial
expenses to keep the team and the project going.

If you wish to make a financial contribution to support us, you can do so at
our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/dosbox-staging) or [Open
Collective][opencollective] pages. 

We are grateful for all donations, no matter how big or small!
