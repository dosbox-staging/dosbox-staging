# The Tandy

1984

The IBM PC computing platform supported gaming from the beginning, but at first its graphical and sound capabilities were not that much more advanced than an Apple II's. Other inexpensive home computers of the day (Atari 800, Commodore 64, TI-99/4A) could run rings around the IBM PC in the video and audio departments. IBM sought to improve its PC line's graphics and sound in an affordable system which became the PCjr., but that was a flop.  Tandy cloned the graphics and sound of the PCjr. and put it into a much more PC-compatible system, the Tandy 1000.  Between the two, the exclusive PCjr./Tandy graphics and sound hardware received wide support from game developers in the mid and late 1980s.  In this article, I will attempt to give a definitive list of games which have "better" graphica or sound on a PCjr. or Tandy 1000 due to this support or have unique video and audio support even if the game can utilize EGA, VGA, Adlib, Game Blaster or Sound Blaster or MT-32.

CGA - 1981


HGC (Hercules) - 1982


EGA - 1984

By 1987, EGA support was commonplace.[15] Most software made up to 1991 could run in EGA, although the vast majority of commercial games used 320×200 with 16 colors for backwards compatibility with CGA and Tandy, and to support users who did not own an enhanced EGA monitor. 350-line modes were mostly used by freeware/shareware games and application software, although SimCity is a notable example of a commercial game that runs in 640×350×16 mode.[16][17]

AMD 386DX-40 - 1991

While Intel's 386 CPUs had topped out at 33 MHz in 1989, AMD introduced 40 MHz versions of both its 386DX and 386SX out of the gate, extending the lifespan of the architecture. In the following two years the AMD 386DX-40 saw popularity with small manufacturers of PC clones and with budget-minded computer enthusiasts because it offered near-80486 performance at a much lower price than an actual 486.[4] Generally the 386DX-40 performs nearly on par with a 25 MHz 486 due to the 486 needing fewer clock cycles per instruction, thanks to its tighter pipelining (more overlapping of internal processing) in combination with an on-chip CPU cache. However, its 32-bit 40 MHz data bus gave the 386DX-40 comparatively good memory and I/O performance.[5]

The all-time classic of 386 chips, and in our view the greatest individual X86 CPU of them all — certainly the one that brought modern computing to more people than any other.

This was the last and greatest 386, and AMD made it in enormous quantities. The DX-40 was vastly cheaper than a 486SX, which usually could not out-perform it anyway, and easily faster than Intel's best 386, the DX-33.

For year after year these sold, and it seemed like they would never die. Working techies used to love them because 386DX-40 systems just went and went and went. The technology was stable and more than sufficient to cope with the software of the day. If you had to name just one product that made everyday computing reliable and affordable, this would be it.

Put 33 MHz 486 systems to shame, and was able to keep on doing so right up until the day of the 486-66.
fast, very cheap, and completely trouble-free.




486DX/2-66 - 1992

The classic 486, memorable for several different reasons. The DX-4/66 story started with the original Intel part, which was a genuine speed demon by the standards of the day, and very expensive indeed. 

When you bought a DX/2-66, the performance difference from your previous unit — be that 386DX-40, 486SX or 486DLC — was immediately obvious, more so than many another upgrade. There was nothing subtle about the extra snap your system had after dropping in a DX/2.



Intel Pentium 60 - 1993

It became the best-selling CPU in the world and, in various flavours, remained so for four years — a very long time in this industry. 


Intel Pentium 90 - 1994

The Pentium is one of the all-time classic CPUs, and though it seems strange to think of it that way now, the 100 was one of the all-time classic Pentiums.


Pentium-133 - 1995

Arguably the definitive Pentium, and certainly one of the very best. Like the 100 and the 166 it ran a 66MHz bus to give it good I/O performance, and like those two it was the fastest X86 of all for quite some time. 


Pentium 166 - 1996

The power-user's chip of choice for a long, long time, and still a very good performer right up to the close of the century. Generally regarded as the classic Pentium, and the one that will be remebered longest. Probably the most common of all the Pentium parts too.


Pentium MMX-166, MMX-200, MMX-233 - 1997

Another one of the great Intel classics, last and best of all the Pentiums.

TANDY



By 1987, most games did support EGA graphics, which can display identical graphics to the Tandy 1000, so the need for a Tandy 1000 was dwindling.  Toward the end of 1988, Sierra and other game companies began supporting discrete sound cards like the Adlib and midi devices like the Roland MT-32.  Thus the importance of the 3-voice sound began to wane and by 1990 with the Sound Blaster's digital audio playback support, the need for a Tandy 1000 was all but eliminated.

What kind of games would be played on this machine?  Well, all the important PC originals from 1981-1990. I will include any game whose maximum resolution was 320x200x16 and supports Tandy graphics or supports the Tandy sound chip for music and/or effects that does not support an Adlib, Sound Blaster, Roland MT-32 or Game Blaster.  Some examples include :

Thexder - Although the game supports an EGA 640x200x16 mode, which is appropriate considering its Japanese origins on the PC-88, it supports Tandy Sound for its music (all of two pieces).  Sound effects are PC Speaker only.

Secret of the Silver Blades, Champions of Krynn & Death Knights of Krynn - All support Adlib music, but if you select Adlib you get PC Speaker sound effects.  Tandy gives better sound effects than the speaker. Music only tends to be in the introduction to those games.
