# PC speaker

The PC Speaker was the integrated speaker from the earliest IBM PCâ€™s. It was
really only meant for simple beeps, but ended up widely used by PC games as it
was the lowest common-denominator for PC sound, despite its very limited
capabilities.

It is effectively a single-channel square-wave generator, and with
considerable CPU overhead it was possible to get some half-decent sound out of
it as demonstrated by RealSound.

Sound quality was heavily dependent on the type of speaker and the placement
and PC case it was built into. Originally a dynamic speaker was used, but
later model PCs used a tiny piezo speaker instead which further reduced sound
quality and volume.

PC Speaker emulation is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting
pcspeaker=false in the [speaker] section of the DOSBox-X config file.


With clever programming, the PC speaker could act as a crude synth, or even
play digital audio, enabling speech in games like the original Castle
Wolfenstein.
