## Reverb

Enable reverb globally to add a sense of space to the sound:

`off`
: No reverb (default).

`on`
: Enables the `medium` preset.

`tiny`
: Simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a room; specifically
  designed for small-speaker audio systems (PC Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and
  LPT DAC devices).

`small`
: Adds a subtle sense of space; good for games that use a single synth
  channel (typically OPL) for both music and sound effects.

`medium`
: Medium room preset that works well with a wide variety of games.

`large`
: Large hall preset recommended for games that use separate
  channels for music and digital audio.

`huge`
: A stronger variant of the large hall preset; works really well
  in some games with more atmospheric soundtracks.

You can fine-tune per-channel reverb levels via mixer commands.


## Chorus

Enable chorus globally to add a sense of stereo movement to the sound:

`off`
: No chorus (default).

`on`
: Enable chorus (normal preset).

`light`
: A light chorus effect (especially suited for
  synth music that features lots of white noise.)

`normal`
: Normal chorus that works well with a wide variety of games.

`strong`
: An obvious and upfront chorus effect.

You can fine-tune per-channel chorus levels via mixer commands.
