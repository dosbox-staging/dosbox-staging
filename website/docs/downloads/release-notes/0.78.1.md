- Fixed a regression that impacted 32-bit performance on some Windows systems *(RaymanXY; Kirk Klobe and kcgen)*
- Fixed a regression that causes a crash when opening UPX-compressed code-page files *(FeralChild64; Wengier)*

## Functionality refinements

- Improved the modem's command-mode handling *(NicknineTheEagle)*
- Corrected the modem's DTR drop delay units from ms to hundredths of a second *(NicknineTheEagle)*
- Reverted the allowance that let the VESA refresh rate use the host rate *(RaymanXY; kcgen)*
- Allowed read-only image mounting for write-protected disk and floppy images *(Burrito78; Wengier)*


## Documentation-related improvements

- Updated the German messages and config file text *(Burrito78)*
- Updated the Italian messages and config file text *(Kappa971)*
- Fixed a documentation conflict describing the command line's version flag *(arrowgent)*
- Documented how to install gmock, a dependency added during 0.78.0, on Fedora *(oturpe)*


## Development and packaging fixes

- Fixed a compilation issue with Loguru on ARM32 using GCC 8 *(rtissera; kcgen)*
- Fixed a compilation issue with older C++17 compilers missing `std::filesystem` support *(jowtron; gulrak and kcgen)*
- Fixed a build tool-specific bug that exposed the UI when running gmock tests *(oturpe and voyageur; brandonrobertz and kcgen)*


## Known issues

- The MSYS2-built debugger will fail to open if launched from the Windows UI.
    - As a work-around, run it from within a command console.
    - Thanks to *Sherman Perry* for investigating this issue and isolating it to the Windows Console API.

- Audio might stutter on some Windows platforms. If your system is affected, adjust the mixer's settings in your config file as follows:

      ``` ini
      [mixer]
      blocksize = 1024
      prebuffer = 25
      ```
    !!! tip

        Run `dosbox -editconf` to open your config file.

    Thanks to *Genju* for reporting this regression and isolating the solution.
