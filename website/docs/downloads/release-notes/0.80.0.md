# 0.80.0 release notes

**Release date:** 2022-12-21

## Summary

[ReelMagic][reelmagic] DOS games are now playable thanks to the efforts of Jon
Dennis, Chris Guthrie, and Joseph Whittaker, with testing and feedback from
Vogons users Uka, DonutKing, and Vetz. Mouse emulation has been improved and
now supports up to six independent mice, enabling split-screen play in games
like [The Settlers][settlers1] and [The Settlers II][settlers2]. More
settings, including video, audio, and mixer effects, can now be changed on the
fly. Following macOS, high DPI support on multi-display setups now comes to
Windows. A new `--working-dir` command line flag allows DOSBox Staging to
launch from a specific working directory. Repo packagers should note that
**sdl2_image** is now a dependency.

## How to upgrade

Get started by downloading the latest version and updating your configuration
file:

### Downloads

<div class="compact" markdown>

- [Linux](../linux.md)
- [Windows](../windows.md)
- [macOS](../macos.md)

</div>

### Upgrade your configuration file

1. Launch the new release.
2. At the`Z:\>` prompt, run `config -wc` to write the new configuration file.

!!! note

    - Existing settings will be retained, but extraneous comments will be
      dropped.

    - Starting with version 0.80, the configuration file is written in the
      language in which DOSBox Staging was started.

    - To write an English configuration file, launch with the `-lang en`
      command-line flag (to start DOSBox Staging in English) and then (re-)write
      your configuration file.


## New features

### ReelMagic support

DOS [ReelMagic][reelmagic] games are now playable thanks to Jon Dennis's
[patch](https://github.com/jrdennisoss/dosboxrm) with help from Chris Guthrie
and Joseph Whittaker.

See the `[reelmagic]` section in your configuration file to enable this. We
suggest only enabling ReelMagic emulation on an as-needed basis.

</figure>

Jon plans to add DMA support (primarily used by the ReelMagic Windows 3.1x
driver and games) when time permits, but most ReelMagic games for DOS are
already fully functional and playable.


### Mouse improvements

#### Dedicated configuration section

The mouse configuration has been moved to its own section and additional
options have been added. A tool called `mousectl` is available on `Z:` for
more detailed per-interface mouse configuration.
 
#### Dual mouse gaming

Multiple physical mice can now be mapped to specific emulated mouse
interfaces, enabling two-player split-screen gaming ([The Settlers][settlers1]
and [The Settlers II][settlers2]) using two USB mice on a single computer.

See the [wiki
article](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/Dual-Mouse-Gaming)
for more details.

#### Improved support for third-party INT33 Windows mouse drivers
 
*javispedro*'s [INT33 mouse driver](https://git.javispedro.com/cgit/vbados.git/about/)
for Windows 3.1x is fully supported and no longer requires the use of the
separate DOS driver, except when booting from a disk image. The driver also
resolves compatibility issues with seamless mouse integration and adds mouse
wheel support.

See the [wiki
article](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/Windows-3.1x#improved-mouse-driver)
for more details.

#### Mouse-related help in the title bar

The title bar now displays some short help about the mouse, such as how it can
be captured or released.

### High DPI on Windows

Following macOS, high DPI support now comes to Windows: the DOSBox window
should scale nicely along other programs, and retain correct dimensions when
moving between monitors with different scaling factors set.

!!! note

    This feature is currently experimental! If you notice any weird behaviour,
    [please report it!](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/issues/new/choose)

### Ability to use local configs via Finder on macOS

A new `--working-dir <path>` command line parameter has been introduced to
make it possible to launch DOSBox Staging using local configs from the Finder
on macOS. Previously, you had to use DOSBox from the command line to achieve
this.
 
#### How to use it

Follow the steps indicated in the DMG package, as shown:

<figure markdown>
  ![macOS DMG run-command tip](../images/macos_dmg_run_command.png){ width=85% loading=lazy }
</figure>

Simply copy the included `Start DOSBox Staging.command` to any folder that
contains a local `dosbox.conf` and then open it (`Start DOSBox
Staging.command`) in Finder. DOSBox Staging will act as if started from that
folder and will pick up the local config.
 
!!! note

    You might be asked to give DOSBox Staging access to the containing folder
    upon the first launch---just click OK if that dialog comes up.

 
## General improvements

### `more.com` command

The `more` command is now internally implemented (should be more user-friendly
than the original DOS one), and its engine is used for displaying help
messages longer than one screen.

### On-the-fly changes

Several settings can be safely adjusted at runtime, including the output video
settings, resolution, OpenGL shaders, audio devices, and mixer settings.

### Post-rendered screenshots

DOSBox has long provided the ++ctrl+f5++ hotkey to capture the emulated video
card's image prior to rendering.

DOSBox Staging 0.80 now pairs this with ++alt+f5++ (or ++opt+f5++ on macOS) to
capture the as-seen (post-rendered) image.


### More bundled OpenGL shaders

The balance of usable shaders from [Tyrells' CRT shader
collection](https://github.com/tyrells/dosbox-svn-shaders), as well as
GranMinigun's interpolating Catmull–Rom spline shader have been added.

Launch DOSBox Staging with the `--list-glshaders` command-line argument to list
the available OpenGL shaders. For example:

```
List of available GLSL shaders

  off at runtime via the mixer command.

- FluidSynth's specific reverb and chorus configuration settings are now applied
  and will replace the default values that were previously always applied.

- The modem's call now has a warm-up period where it will discard data. This
  fixes a bug noted in **Duke Nukem 3D** where it would fail its initial
  handshake on the first try.

## Translation improvements

### Translations

<div class="compact" markdown>

* German: up-to-date
* Italian: up-to-date
* Polish: up-to-date
* Russian: up-to-date
* French: not updated
* Spanish: not updated

</div>

### Related improvements

- The title bar is now translatable.

- The Brazilian ABNT2 slash and question mark keys are now handled.

- Translations are now stored in UTF-8 and converted to the selected DOS
  codepage, dropping accents if needed, sometimes even performing crude
  transliterations (for Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets DOSBox
  shouldn't display garbled messages anymore regardless which codepage is
  selected). This is especially important for languages where more than one
  incompatible encoding was used in the DOS era. All FreeDOS codepages are
  supported. Note that only DOSBox Staging's own messages benefit from this
  feature.
