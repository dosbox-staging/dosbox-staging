# 0.80.1 release notes

**Release date:** 2023-01-06

## Summary

This maintenance release fixes minor issues with the mouse defaults, modem and
Ethernet connection handling, and Meson dependencies.

We are also happy to report that the high DPI improvements in the previous
0.80.0 release have been verified on Windows, meaning that high DPI support is
now functional on all platforms. Thanks to *GranMinigun* for this addition!

This maintenance release was made possible by everyone who tried 0.80.0,
submitted bugs and pull requests, and tested the updates: thank you!


## How to upgrade

Get started by downloading the latest version and updating your configuration
file:

### Downloads

<div class="compact" markdown>

- [Linux](/downloads/linux/)

- [macOS](/downloads/macos/)

</div>

### Upgrade your configuration file

2. At the`Z:\>` prompt, run `config -wc` to write the new configuration file.

!!! note

    - Existing settings will be retained, but extraneous comments will be
      dropped.


## Bug and regression fixes

- The mouse will now be captured only after the first click inside the window.
  For users without a windowing environment, the previous capture-on-start
  behavior will remain unchanged.

- The captured mouse will now be centered in the window upon release.

- The softmodem now includes a brief warm-up period where it will drop initial
  unreliable data, similar to hardware modems. This allows **Duke Nukem 3D** to
  establish its data connection on the first attempt.

- A potential slow memory leak related to closed Ethernet connections has been
  fixed.

- A bug that caused the `C:` mount to become unlistable after launching DOSBox
  Staging with a command-line mount while using `MORE.COM` has been fixed.

- The xinput2 library, an optional dependency of ManyMouse, can now be set via
  the Meson options. For more information, see
  [`meson_options.txt`](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/blob/main/meson_options.txt).

- When compiling on ARM platforms, the SpeexDSP wrap will now correctly check if
  the host supports NEON instructions, and use them if available.
