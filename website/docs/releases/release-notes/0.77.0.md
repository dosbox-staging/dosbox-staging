### macOS hotkey changes

Replaced the default ++ctrl+f1++ - ++f12++ hotkeys [on

with ++cmd+f1++ - ++f12++ to reduce conflicts with the OS.

### Improved startup settings

Added `splash_only` to the `startup_verbosity` settings. This shows the splash
but skips the help banner.

### Relative window size support

Three relative window sizes, `small`, `medium`, or `large`, are now understood
by the `windowresolution` config setting. These T-shirt sizes correspond to a
window that's 25%, 50%, or 80% of your desktop's area, regardless of DPI or
type of monitor (be it 720p, 1080p, or 4K).

### Window resizing enabled by default

Window resizing using corner-drag is now auto-enabled on all platforms when
conditions permit.


## Bugfixes

The following user-visible bugs were fixed:

- Will no longer lose focus on Raspberry Pi when launched fullscreen in an Xorg
  session. ([#995](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/995))

- Release builds now use `dosbox-staging.conf` as the primary config file instead of
  `dosbox-staging-git.conf`. ([#932](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/932))

- Windows release builds once again mount Opus CD-DA tracks, which was a
  regression in 0.76. ([#885](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/855))

- `AUTOTYPE` now works with all games. Until now, a subset of games didn't
  respond to its keystrokes.
  ([#942](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/942))

- Shoulder triggers on some six-axis controllers, such as the PS4 and
  Logitech's F310 and F710 controllers, can now be mapped.
  ([#944](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/944))

- When toggling out of fullscreen mode, in some corner cases this resulted in
  a [blank window](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/issues/1094). This
  is now fixed. ([#1096](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1096))
