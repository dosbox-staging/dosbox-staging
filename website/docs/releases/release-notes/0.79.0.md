# 0.79.0 release notes

**Release date:** 2022-09-19

## How to upgrade

Download and launch the latest version:

<div class="compact" markdown>

- [Linux](../linux.md) (or [Steam on Linux](../linux.md#steam))
- [Windows](../windows.md)
- [macOS](../macos.md)

</div>

At the`Z:\>` prompt, run `config -wc` to write the new configuration file. Any
existing settings will be retained, however, extraneous comments will be
dropped.


## What you can expect

- It should run everything that prior versions did.

- The default settings will give you improved audio, refined graphical scaling
  and colour accuracy, more robust mouse handling, and a more usable shell.

- There are new and some deprecated config settings: your console log will
  inform you with orange-coloured warning messages to help you.

- For performance-demanding games that use `max` cycles, it should provide
  just as much performance (or a bit more) than prior versions.

- **International users**: it should detect your language and keyboard layout
  on startup. We recommend reading the Localisation section for details.

- **Repo packagers**: learn about [bundled resource files](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/blob/release/0.79.x/docs/README.resources)
  and the updated Meson [build settings](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/blob/release/0.79.x/BUILD.md#repository-maintainer--packager-builds).

Read on for all the details!


## Audio improvements

### AdLib Gold Surround Module emulation

The ultra-rare AdLib Gold surround sound daughterboard is now emulated, which
makes it possible to finally enjoy the [Dune
soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDE06DE88BB135F33) in its
full glory! That's the only game in existence that makes use of the surround
module.

The following config is recommended for
[Dune](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(video_game)>). The setup utility
should auto-detect AdLib Gold and the surround module correctly with these
settings.

``` ini
[sblaster]
sbtype = sb16
oplmode = opl3gold
```

### Sound card output filter emulation

Most DOS-era sound cards feature an output low-pass filter (and sometimes a
high-pass filter too) that play an important role in giving their sound its
character. DOSBox Staging can now accurately emulate these analog output stage
filters for all supported sound devices.

#### Sound Blaster

For backward compatibility reasons, the `sb_filter` config parameter defaults
to the newly introduced `modern` filter, which uses the simple linear
interpolation method of previous DOSBox versions. To turn on accurate analog
output filter emulation, set the `sb_filter` to `auto`. This will set the
correct filters for each Sound Blaster model depending on the `sb_type` value.
You can also set a model-specific filter manually if you wish, e.g. this is
how to use a Sound Blaster 16 but with Sound Blaster Pro filters:

``` ini
[sblaster]
sbtype = sb16
sb_filter = sbpro1
```

Some Sound Blaster models can toggle the filter on and off in software; you
can force the filter to be always on by setting `sb_filter_always_on` to
`true`.

OPL and CMS filters are also accurately emulated; please refer to the
descriptions of the `opl_filter` and `cms_filter` config parameters for
further details.

#### Small-speaker systems

Filters are enabled by default for all small-speaker audio systems (PC
Speaker, PS/1 Audio, Tandy, and the various LPT DAC options). Depending on the
particular device, these filters either emulate the analog output filters of
the original device, or the sound coming out of a small band-limited speaker
in an acoustic environment. Either way, the result is a more period-accurate
and pleasant listening experience, especially on headphones.

Small-speaker filters are controlled by the following config parameters:

<div class="compact" markdown>

- `lpt_dac_filter`
- `pcspeaker_filter`
- `ps1audio_dac_filter`
- `ps1audio_filter`
- `tandy_dac_filter`
- `tandy_filter`

</div>

#### Custom filters

Advanced users can specify custom filter settings for any of the supported
sound devices. You can specify either a high-pass filter, a low-pass filter,
or both at the same time using the following format

    TYPE ORDER FREQ [TYPE ORDER FREQ]

where **TYPE** can be `hpf` (high-pass) or `lpf` (low-pass), **ORDER** is the
order of the filter from 1 to 16 (1st order results in a 6dB per octave slope,
2nd order in a 12dB per octave slope, etc.), and **FREQ** is the filter's
cutoff frequency in Hz.

For example, to use a 2nd order (12dB/oct) low-pass filter at 8 kHz for the
Sound Blaster:

``` ini
sb_filter = lpf 2 8000
```

To use a 3rd order (18dB/oct) high-pass filter at 120 Hz, and a 1st order
(6dB/oct) low-pass filter at 6.5 kHz for the PC Speaker:

``` ini
pcspeaker_filter = hpf 3 120 lfp 1 6500
```

In addition to the sound devices mentioned above, you can use custom filters
even with devices that don't filter the output in the original hardware (e.g.
GUS, MT-32), and the FluidSynth virtual MIDI device via the following config
parameters:

<div class="compact" markdown>

- `fsynth_filter`
- `gus_filter`
- `innovation_filter`
- `mt32_filter`

</div>


### Crossfeed

Listening to audio material on headphones where certain sounds are only
present in either the left or the right channel can be a rather distracting
and unpleasant experience. This is most noticeable on certain Dual OPL game
soundtracks and tracker music (e.g. MOD, XM, S3M, IT, etc.)

The new crossfeed feature remedies that; by enabling `crossfeed` in the
`[mixer]` section, a certain percentage of the left channel is mixed into the
right, and vice versa. The default crossfeed strength is 40% which is a good
general setting, but you can provide a custom percentage value as well (e.g.
`crossfeed = 55`).

The amount of crossfeed can be fine-tuned per individual channels via mixer
commands; please type `MIXER /?` in the DOSBox prompt for further details.


### Reverb and chorus

#### Reverb

One of the most exciting new audio features is the ability to add reverb (the
emulation of real acoustic spaces) and chorus effects to any mixer channel.
This can add a lot of atmosphere to dry-sounding synth soundtracks (typically
OPL music) and elevate them to a whole new level! Enabling reverb and chorus
processing is especially useful for headphone-listening.

The quickest way to enable the **reverb effect** globally is to put `reverb =
on` in the `[mixer]` config section. This will add reverb to all synth
channels (e.g. PC Speaker, OPL, CMS), and a lesser amount to digital audio
channels (e.g. Sound Blaster, GUS). While the default setting works well with
most games, it's highly recommended to experiment with the five available
reverb presets to find the optimal setting for each game:

- `tiny` simulates the sound of a small integrated speaker in a domestic room.
  This preset is specifically tailored for small-speaker audio systems (PC
  Speaker, Tandy, PS/1 Audio, and LPT DAC devices).

- `small` adds a subtle sense of space; it's best suited for games that use a
  single synth (typically OPL) for both the music and the sound
  effects.

- `medium` is the default preset; it's a middle-of-the-road setting that works
  well with a wide variety of games.

- `large` is a large hall-style reverb that is recommended for games that use
  separate audio channels for music and digital audio (e.g. OPL audio and
  Sound Blaster digital sound.)

- `huge` is a stronger variant of the large hall preset which is ideal for
  slower-paced, atmospheric music.

#### Chorus

Another way to add a sense of space to the sound is by enabling the **chorus
effect**. This adds stereo movement and increases the perceived stereo width,
which is especially noticeable on purely mono signals on headphones (e.g. PC
Speaker or OPL2 music). To enable it, just put `chorus = on` into the
`[mixer]` config section, or select one of the three predefined chorus
strength presets (`light`, `normal`, and `strong`).

Similarly to crossfeed, per-channel reverb and chorus settings can be tweaked
by mixer commands; please type `MIXER /?` in the DOSBox prompt for details.

**Audio examples**

Naturally, you can combine chorus and reverb, and it's not only possible to do
so, but highly recommended for achieving the best results! The below
recordings showcase how crossfeed, reverb, chorus, and output stage filters
can work in tandem to give old DOS game soundtracks a new life.

The exact settings used for these recordings are documented
[on the wiki](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/Audio-configuration-recommendations),
along with suggested audio configs for many other games. Make sure to check
them out and experiment with the settings yourself! ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ”‰ ðŸŽ§

### Master compressor

An auto-levelling dynamic range compressor has been introduced to the master
channel to ensure that the audio output never gets distorted, no matter how
high the volume levels are. This is on by default and is virtually transparent
when the output is not driven into clipping. However, purists can disable it
by setting `compressor` to `off`, and then ensure correct non-clipping output
levels manually.


### General mixer improvements

- The mixer now uses a full 32-bit floating-point processing path internally,
  which means you can no longer overload individual mixer channels into
  clipping by using high per-channel volume settings. As long as the summed
  master output is not clipping, it's guaranteed that nothing else will.

- A fixed high-pass filter at 20 Hz has been introduced right before the final
  output that gets rid of any DC-offset and subsonic rumble globally.

- The `MIXER` command has received an overhaul too. First of all, the status
  output looks better, and the following improvements have been made:

    - Now you can set reverb, chorus, and crossfeed levels per mixer channel;
      type `MIXER /?` in the DOSBox prompt for further details.

    - The `FM` channel has been renamed to `OPL`.

    - The `SPKR` channel has been renamed to `PCSPEAKER`.

    - The sample rate column has been removed (it served no useful purpose,
      and the displayed values were often technically correct but misleading).

- For a high-level overview of the new mixer architecture, please refer to
  [this diagram](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/Audio-Mixer-Signal-Flow-Diagram).


### "One OPL mode to rule them all" &#128141;

NukedOPL has long been the default OPL mode in Staging. As it's basically a
bit-perfect emulation of the [Yamaha YMF262 OPL3 chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL#OPL3),
and it runs fast enough even on low-end hardware such as the Raspberry Pi 4,
all other less accurate OPL emulation modes have been removed.


### FluidSynth configuration changes

#### FluidSynth Reverb and Chorus

Due to the introduction of the new mixer-level [reverb and chorus
effects](#ReverbandChorus), the FluidSynth `reverb` and `chorus` config
parameters have been renamed to `fsynth_reverb` and `fsynth_chorus`,
respectively.

To maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations, the
FluidSynth reverb and chorus effects are enabled by default, so all your
SoundFonts will sound just like in previous DOSBox versions. If you enable the
mixer-level reverb (or chorus) as well (e.g. by putting `reverb = on` in the
`[mixer]` section), you would get a *second* round of reverb (or chorus)
processing on the FluidSynth output. This is by design as it allows users the
greatest level of control over customising SoundFonts (e.g. some would sound
best with the FluidSynth reverb only, some with both, etc.)

!!! note

    In the SF2 format the reverb and chorus amounts are specified on a
    per-instrument basis, while the mixer-level effects are applied "globally"
    to all instruments in the summed FluidSynth output. Therefore, what works
    best really depends on the particular SoundFont in question and on
    individual user preference (see [this
    discussion](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1814)
    for further technical details).


#### Volume Scaling

Previously, it was possible to specify a percentage after the SoundFont's name
in the config to adjust its volume (e.g. `soundfont = way_too_loud.sf2 30`).
This was introduced as a workaround for certain loud SoundFonts that tended to
clip the mixer channel internally.

With the new floating-pointing mixer signal path, it's no longer possible to
drive any of the mixer channels into clipping, therefore this workaround has
been deprecated. Please use standard mixer commands to lower the volume of the
`FSYNTH` channel if you wish to do so.


### ripa's PC speaker patch

We've integrated ripa's impulse-model [PC speaker
patch](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=23371) alongside DOSBox's
existing (discrete-model) PC speaker implementation, which is still the
default.

To use it, set the `pcspeaker` config setting to `impulse` (or go back to
default with `discrete`).

*James-F* and *VileRancour* have mentioned in the linked thread that it
generally improves the accuracy of square-wave effects, such as in **Commander
Keen** and **Duke Nukem** (2D). This patch also can produce sounds when none
previously existed, such as in **Wizball**, as noted by *ripsaw8080*.

For example, here's Wizball using the settings below:

``` ini
[mixer]
rate = 32000

[speaker]
pcspeaker = discrete
```

!!! note

    There are some audible regressions and harmonics that still exist in some
    games, so that's why this is an alternative and not the default.


### Parallel port DAC models: Disney, Covox, and Stereo-On-1

Those familiar with DOSBox know that these three devices are emulated with the
universal `disney = true` setting.

Like `sbtype`, we wanted the model of LPT DAC to be configurable, and so
Staging's deprecated the `disney` setting in favour of `lpt_dac` that takes
any of the following:

- `disney`, for the Disney Sound Source
- `covox`, for the Covox Speech Thing
- `ston1`, for the Stereo-on-1 DAC device
- `off/none`, to disable the DAC (default)

This is paired with a corresponding filter setting, `lpt_dac_filter`, which
approximates how the original device sounded. This means that the Disney Sound
Source (which included a little speaker inside it) will sound a lot like you
might remember.

<div class="compact" markdown>

| `lpt_dac` | Examples (ModPlay Pro & Star Control II's 8-bit Pkunk MOD)                                                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disney`  | <audio controls src="https://www.dosbox-staging.org/static/audio/release-notes/0.79.0/modplay-pkunk-lpt-dac-disney.flac"> Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio> |

</div>

Like the other audio filters settings, the `lpt_dac_filter` can be toggled on,
off, or customised.


### Audio mute and pause

The audio stream can now be manually muted with ++ctrl+f8++ (or ++cmd+f8++ on
macOS).

You can also mute the audio automatically when DOSBox Staging goes to the
background with this config setting:

``` ini
[sdl]
mute_when_inactive = true
```

Or you can pause emulation entirely when in the background with:

``` ini
[sdl]
pause_when_inactive = true
```

## Graphical improvements

### Shader reload shortcut

As DOSBox Staging currently lacks a shader preset system, tweaking shader
parameters can only be accomplished by making changes to the shader source
files themselves. Previously, you had to restart DOSBox to see the effects of
such changes, which made fine-tuning shaders quite cumbersome, to say the
least.

Now you can just use the ++ctrl+f2++ shortcut (++cmd+f2++ on macOS) to reload
the current shader at any time. Progress! ðŸ˜Ž


### CGA palette override

Now it is possible to override the default, canonical interpretation of the
16-colour CGA/EGA RGBI palette. The feature overrides the CGA colours in any
CGA/EGA-like mode, so it even works in CGA/EGA modes with an emulated VGA or
TGA (Tandy) graphics adapter.

Several presets have been included (e.g. Amiga and Atari ST colours for Sierra
games, and various CGA/EGA monitor emulations), and you can specify custom
palettes as well. Make sure to check out the description of the `cga_colors`
config parameter for the list of available presets (you can read more about
them
[here](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1794)).

**Defender of the Crown**

`tandy-warm` emulates the colours as they appear on an actual Tandy monitor,
which results in more subdued and pleasant colours. This is especially
apparent on the greens.

### Scaled image quality improvements

When the image is scaled by non-integer ratios (e.g. when aspect correction is
enabled with the default `sharp` OpenGL shader), previously the interpolation
was performed in a gamma-incorrect way, leading to various unwanted artifacts.
These were most noticeable on checkerboard dither patterns (used frequently in
EGA games), appearing as interference (moirÃ©) patterns, and on high-contrast
antialiased text (e.g. regular black text on white background appeared bold).

!!! warning "macOS notes"

    All Mac browsers tend to display the below images with incorrect gamma on
    the built-in MacBook displays, which makes the "bad" images look less
    wrong, and there are slight interference patterns on the "good" images.
    Please download the images and view them in the Preview app instead, which
    displays them correctly.

### High DPI on macOS

The backstory: DOSBox Staging uses OpenGL output with the sharp bilinear
scaling shader to keep the picture crisp no matter how big or small the image
is, and minimise blurring on pixel transitions.

Due to the way macOS handles DPI scaling, the image was drawn at a much lower
resolution, usually just a quarter of the window size. Then it was stretched
by the system, producing an unpleasantly mushy presentation. But we want our
pixels to be so sharp they could cut one's eyes :sunglasses: :dagger:

<div class="image-grid" markdown>

<figure markdown>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

Now DOSBox Staging can handle high DPI displays, be it Retina or not, so you
and shaders alike can see all the (physical) pixels.

Please note that this is currently experimental: only macOS is currently
supported, and we haven't thoroughly tested multi-display setups. Please
report any weird behaviour! Support for Windows will come in the future, and
for Linux, it is still uncertain. Also note that due to the way rendering is
currently implemented, you may observe lowered performance on higher
resolution displays, especially when running off integrated graphics. This
might be remedied in the future as well.


### Window transparency support

There might be situations where you want to place the DOSBox Staging window on
top of another window while seeing both windows at the same time. Indeed, you
can now set the DOSBox Staging window as transparent, with a customised level
of window transparency, so that you can see the background window as well.
There is a new config option `transparency` for this, whose valid values are
between `0` (no transparency; default) to `90` (high transparency).

![Transparent window](https://www.dosbox-staging.org/static/images/release-notes/0.79.0/transparent-window.png){ loading=lazy }


### Frame presentation modes

DOSBox presents frames when new content is available, which means that
sometimes the effective frame rate can vary between 0 FPS (if the screen
content isn't changing) and as fast as the DOS vertical refresh (vblank) rate
(typically up to ~70 Hz). We'll call this presentation mode **Variable Frame
Rate** or **VFR**.

In addition to VFR, DOSBox Staging supports a **Constant Frame Rate (CFR)**
presentation mode, which presents a constant frame rate defined by the
emulated DOS rate, as well as variations on both:

- **Synced CFR**, which presents a constant frame rate but is synchronised
  with the host's refresh rate. This presents only the most recently updated
  frame when the DOS rate exceeds the host rate.

- **Throttled VFR**, which presents a variable frame rate up to the DOS rate
  throttled to the display's rate. This presents only the most recently
  updated frame when the DOS rate exceeds the host rate.

By default, DOSBox Staging inspects runtime conditions and picks the optimal
presentation mode.

  <figcaption markdown>

Although typically not needed, power users might be interested in forcing a
given mode or rate, which can be done using the following config settings
(which includes detailed descriptions in the conf):

``` ini
[sdl]
presentation_mode = auto | cfr | vfr
host_rate = auto | sdi | vrr | custom-rate

[dosbox]
dos_rate = default | host | custom-rate
```

## DOS shell improvements

### Piping from the DOS prompt or batch files

DOSBox did not support the piping operation previously, but DOSBox Staging now
brings piping support as how it has worked in DOS and most other operating
systems. This allows two or more commands to communicate by passing the output
text of one command to another as its input text. For example, commands like
`ECHO Y | CHOICE` will work, so that the `Y` option will be passed as the
input of `CHOICE` command. Chained piping is also supported, such as `DIR |
SORT | MORE` for displaying sorted directory output one screen at a time
(provided that you have the `SORT` and `MORE` commands from MS-DOS or FreeDOS
in your path). If the current directory and `C:\` are both read-only, the
environment variable `%TEMP%` (or `%TMP%`) needs to be set within DOS pointing
to a writable directory so that piping will work properly (e.g. `SET
TEMP=C:\TEMP`).


### File attribute support and ATTRIB command

File attributes contain information about how the files should be used, and in
DOS these correspond to Archive (`A`), Read-only (`R`), Hidden (`H`), and
System (`S`) attributes. DOSBox Staging now adds support for file attributes
through `ATTRIB` command (type `ATTRIB /?` for more information about this
command) or through DOS API that accesses to file attributes. For example,
some game installers and applications make use of file attributes. All file
attributes are currently supported except for system and hidden attributes on
mounted local drives for non-Windows platforms.

![ATTRIB command help](https://www.dosbox-staging.org/static/images/release-notes/0.79.0/attrib-help.png){ loading=lazy }


### Default choices for the CHOICE command

The `CHOICE` command allows you to choose from a list of options, but
sometimes you want to have some default choice if no selection is made within
the specific time period. DOSBox Staging now allows you to do this, by
specifying the `/T` option which includes a default choice and the time period
in seconds. For example, `CHOICE /C:ABC /T:B,2` will default to the choice `B`
(among `A`, `B`, and `C`) if no key press is made within 2 seconds.


## Mount improvements

### Physical CD-ROM mount support

Mounting physical CDs is now (re-)implemented in DOSBox Staging for better
compatibility with games like **Under a Killing Moon**, **System Shock**, and
**The Pandora Directive**. The feature is supported in DOSBox SVN but was
forced to be dropped from DOSBox Staging earlier during the SDL2 migration
process. We've brought it back by using the SDL1 CD support code as an
external library, plus restoring the main SDL CD interface from DOSBox.

To use the feature, execute the command `mount -cd` to list all CD drives and
their numbers, and use `-usecd NUMBER` parameter to specify a CD drive
`NUMBER`, just like you would do in DOSBox SVN. Playing CD audio tracks from
physical discs is also supported in Windows as with DOSBox SVN.

![Mount support for Physical CD](https://www.dosbox-staging.org/static/images/release-notes/0.79.0/mount-cd.png){ loading=lazy }


### Read-only disk image mount support

You might have encountered the problem previously that you could not mount
write-protected disk images, which happened simply because DOSBox Staging
required write access to mount disk images.

Sometimes the user may also want to mount a disk image in a read-only manner
(so that the content in the disk image will not be changed inside the
emulator), even if the disk image itself is not write-protected. We have
realised that in either case the requirement for write access is not needed
for mounting disk images, so we have added support for mounting them in a
read-only manner, either when the disk image files are read-only or when the
`-ro` flag is specified by the users.


### Z-drive customisation and directory support

The internal Z drive that is automatically mounted when you launch DOSBox
Staging is now fully customisable, allowing users to add their own files or
programs to the drive by putting them in the `drivez` subdirectory inside the
DOSBox Staging program directory. Files already existing on the Z drive will
be replaced by the user-provided ones, e.g. you can use your own `MEM.COM` or
`KEYB.COM` commands instead of the default ones on the Z drive. Moreover,
support for one-level subdirectories has been added, allowing users to better
organise their files, resulting in a cleaner-looking Z drive. The drive's
contents can be refreshed via the `RESCAN` command to reflect any changes made
to it at the host OS level.


### IMGMOUNT wildcard support

The `IMGMOUNT` command allows you to mount disk or CD images, but sometimes
you may want to mount multiple images to a single drive, swappable via a
keyboard shortcut. Previously you had to specify the names of the all the
image files one by one, even if they have some patterns in common (like
`DISK1.IMG`, `DISK2.IMG`, `DISK3.IMG`, etc). `IMGMOUNT` command now supports
wildcards for mounting image files, so that you can just specify a file
pattern that matches all the image files that you want to include. For
example, the command `IMGMOUNT a d:\*.img -t floppy` will mount all image
files with the IMG extension on `D:\` as floppy images.

![Mount images with wildcard](https://www.dosbox-staging.org/static/images/release-notes/0.79.0/imgmount-wildcard.png){ loading=lazy }


### Automount of resource drives

Directories can now be automounted, provided the `automount` config setting is
enabled (which it is, by default).

These automount directories are single-letter directories, `a` through `y`
representing the mounted drive letter (where `z` is reserved for DOSBox's
drive) placed inside a local `drives/` directory, relative to the startup
location. This `drives/` directory can also be placed in a scanned resource
location, like your DOSBox config directory or the release package's
`resources/` area.

Each drive can be customised with an accompanying `<letter>.conf` to define
its mount `type`, `label`, and `path`. For example, to mount a local
`drives/d/` directory as a `D:` CD-ROM with the label `SIERRA`, the
accompanying `d.conf` would contain:

``` ini
[drive]
type = cdrom
label = SIERRA
```

A bundled `Y:` automount is provided in the release's `resources/` directory
that bundles a couple FreeDOS 3rd party tools (`XCOPY.COM`, `DELTREE.COM`,
`DEBUG.COM`) along with an accompanying `y.conf` to add it to the PATH.

!!! note

    This feature doesn't yet support image mounts, such as `.img`, `.bin/cue`,
    or `.iso`.


## Localisation improvements

### Code pages and keyboard layouts

The 20-year-old FreeDOS code pages (screen fonts) and keyboard layouts were
updated to the latest versions, offering countless new definitions for use.
See the full list in the following documentation:

- [List of available code pages](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/blob/1ae448a58ef03bf9d5b69a3a9017df07ac6029f6/contrib/resources/freedos-cpi/DOC/CODEPAGE.TXT)
- [List of available keyboard layouts](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/blob/1ae448a58ef03bf9d5b69a3a9017df07ac6029f6/contrib/resources/freedos-keyboard/DOC/LAYOUTS.TXT)

Some notable examples:

- `KEYB bg 3021` --- sets a Bulgarian keyboard layout and code page, with
  Cyrillic characters encoded according to the MIK standard

- `KEYB cz489 867` --- a so-called programmer keyboard layout (national
  characters available with ++ralt+0++ - ++9++) for Czech and Slovak
  languages, with KamenickÃ½ character encoding - which was more popular than
  code page 852

- `KEYB de 858` --- German keyboard, code page with EUR currency symbol

- `KEYB hu 3845` --- Hungarian keyboard, CWI-2 character encoding

- `KEYB pl 668` --- code page specially designed for the Polish language;
  places national characters on the same positions as standard code page 852
  (so it is compatible with current software and text documents), but
  preserves more table drawing symbols

- `KEYB pl 667` --- Mazovia encoding for Polish language, used mainly by older
  business software


### Country support for different date, time, and decimal formats

The display formats for dates, times, and decimals were previously fixed to
the United States style, but this is no longer the case with this new version.
Indeed, DOSBox Staging can now display date, time, and decimal formats
according to the system locale and country settings, and for example, in the
Canadian French locale (country code 2) the date and time will be displayed as
`2002-10-01 12:34` instead of `10-01-2002 12:34p` as displayed in the United
States locale (country code 1). There is a new config option `country` which
allows you to manually specify the country code for the date, time, and
decimal formats.

### Local language and keyboard layout detection improvements

On macOS and Windows systems, local languages now are more robustly detected
and applied.

Note that these can still be manually set using the `language` and
`keyboardlayout` config settings when needed, or via the `KEYB` command as
mentioned above.


## Input improvements

### Mouse-wheel emulation

The built-in mouse driver now provides a wheel support for application aware
of CuteMouse extensions; examples include **Necromancer's DOS Navigator** and
**Mpxplay**.

The original CuteMouse driver version 2.1 is also able to use the PS/2 mouse
wheel, just start it with `CTMOUSE /o`.


### Serial mice emulation

Numerous serial (COM port) mice are now emulated:

- original Microsoft mouse with 2 buttons
- Logitech mouse, with 3 buttons
- wheel mouse with 3 buttons
- Mouse Systems mouse (old mouse type, not compatible with the ones listed
  above), with 3 buttons

To enable serial mouse, user the `SERIAL 1 mouse` command (this will attach it
to the COM1 port), or edit the `[serial]` section of the configuration file.
By default, DOSBox Staging tries to determine what kind of mouse the game or
application expects.

With serial mouse emulation, Windows 1.01 is finally usable!


### Windows 3.1 seamless mouse integration

It is now possible to have a seamless mouse integration using one of the
following 3rd party VMware-compatible Windows 3.1 mouse drivers:

- [VBADOS](https://git.javispedro.com/cgit/vbados.git/about/) by *javispedro*
  --- this one requires a corresponding DOS mouse driver to be started; this
  driver also provides seamless mouse integration for a real DOS if booted
  inside DOSBox Staging

- [vmwmouse](https://github.com/NattyNarwhal/vmwmouse) by *NattyNarwhal* ---
  does not require any specific DOS driver and has experimental support for
  mouse wheel, but current version 0.1 has stability problems

For now, only the mouse is supported (no VMware directory sharing, etc.), only
using VMware protocol (no VirtualBox-only drivers). Windows 9x VMware mouse
driver is not supported.


### Joystick calibration hotkeys

Most DOS games that offer analog joystick control include some form of
calibration. However, some games have poor or limited calibration resulting in
the joystick's position drifting or being offset, despite calibration
attempts.

To compensate for these rare cases, DOSBox Staging lets you adjust the
joystick's X and Y position parameters in real time by enabling the
`use_joy_calibration_hotkeys` setting in the `[joystick]` config section.

Once activated, you can tap ++ctrl++ + *arrow-keys* or ++alt++ + *arrow-keys*
to adjust either the joystick's scalar multiplier or absolute offset position,
respectively. These let you "counterbalance" calibration issues in real time.

Each tap of the hotkeys will log the calibration values for the given axis.
For example:

``` ini
x_calibration = 0.576211,0.02
y_calibration = 0.5474,-0.005
```

Once you've found the optimal settings for a game, the logged calibration
values can be placed in the game's local config file (so the setting are only
active for the affected game). Using the above as an example:

``` ini
[joystick]
use_joy_calibration_hotkeys = false
joy_x_calibration           = 0.576211,0.02
joy_y_calibration           = 0.5474,-0.005
```

Note that you can disable the calibration hotkeys once you've found settings
that work for a problematic game.

Here's a video showing how the calibration hotkeys "pull" the joystick in
various directions:

## General improvements

### Command-line setting of configuration options

Some people may want to temporarily run DOSBox Staging with specified config
option(s), and in this new version you can do this with the new `-set`
command-line option when launching DOSBox Staging, instead of having to modify
the configuration file before you start DOSBox Staging.

For example, the user can temporarily run DOSBox Staging with the EMS memory
disabled with the command line `dosbox -set ems=false`, overriding the setting
in the configuration file.

The `-set` option can be specified multiple times for different config
options, similar to the `-c` option which can be used multiple times to run
multiple commands after DOSBox Staging starts.


### Windows installer for Windows users

Previously, DOSBox Staging was only available as portable zip packages for
Windows users, but this has changed in this new version---as a Windows user
you can now install DOSBox Staging more easily with the installer, which is
especially recommended for new and first-time users. When the installer is
used, the installation process will be automated while allowing you to change
certain things like the installation folder, and you will be able to launch
DOSBox Staging as soon as the installation ends. Shell context menus can also
be automatically added for a faster launch of DOSBox Staging from Windows
Explorer.

</figure>


### Configurable modem connect speeds

The soft-modem's reported connect speed can be customised using the serial
port's `baudrate` setting. for example:

``` ini
serial1 = modem baudrate:2400
```

Although this doesn't change the underlying baud rate, it can help satisfy old
modem software if it's unable to handle (or parse) the larger connect values.


### Handling options for memory faults in buggy games

Extremely rare programming bugs ðŸ˜‰ in some DOS games (and programs) may cause
them to accidentally write data beyond their allocated memory region, similar
to "painting outside the lines". DOSBox is great at catching these instances:
it flags the corruption and quits, preventing the program from barreling on
and possibly doing more harm such as writing corrupt save games, documents,
and so on.

DOSBox Staging defaults to this same behaviour, but adds the `[dosbox]
mcb_fault_strategy` config setting:

| mcb_fault_strategy | Behaviour | How it affects the buggy game |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deny` | Report and quit as soon as a fault is detected (default) | Game terminates, no risk of subsequent file corruption |
| `repair` | Report and repair up to 100 sequential faults | Game continues, but may still be unstable if its developers expected the corruption |
| `report` | Report the corruption and carry on | Game continues, but risks further instability and file corruption |
| `allow` | Carry on without reporting | Game continues, but risks further instability and file corruption |

Only consider this if your game is prone to crashing with MCB chain corruption errors reported in the console log.


## Developer-related improvements

### Self-documenting bit twiddling with bit_view

We've implemented a `bit_view` C++ class using constant expressions to access
a subset of a data-field's bits, allowing them to be read, written, assigned,
flipped, cleared, and tested, without the need to for the usual twiddling
operations.

Constructing a `bit_view` is similar to a C bitfield, however unlike C
bitfields, `bit_view`s are free from undefined behaviour and have been proven
using GCC's and Clang's undefined behaviour sanitisers.

There's more detail and some code examples
[here](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/1708).


### Memory block and type size simplification

The emulated main memory (up to 64 MiB) and the video card's memory (to up 8
MiB) are both now allocated statically to reduce pressure on heap storage
(#1714).

More progress has been made in reducing the use of large variables type-sizes
down to purpose-fit sizes per the DOS/hardware specification (typically 8 or
16-bit) (#1721).


### Tracy profiler integration

The [Tracy event profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) has been
integrated into the build system and basic hooks are in place to log frames
and tics. These are only active (and not compiled in) unless Tracy is enabled.

Here's what it looks like:

It can be enabled at build-time with `-Dtracy=true`. Learn more about it, and
how to build the server-side component here: #1749


### Continuous integration MSYS2 workflow improvements

The MSYS2-based workflow has been brought in line with current best practices,
which dramatically improved its build time and lead to us now using it to
generate the default Windows release binaries.


### Release-package shell script

Release packages are now generated using a cross-platform POSIX-compliant
shell script. With this logic moved into a script, developers can now easily
test the creation of a release package locally, which was previously
impossible as that logic only lived in a GitHub-syntax YAML.


### Static analysis

The team continues to fix and address static analysis issues as flagged by
various analysers. Here are our Coverity Scan metrics to-date:

## Translation status

<div class="compact" markdown>

- German: up-to-date
- Italian: up-to-date
- Polish: up-to-date
- Russian: config sections up-to-date
- French: not updated
- Spanish: not updated

</div>

The 0.79.0 configuration file is also in UTF-8 format for the German, Italian,
and Polish languages under the package's
`resources/translated-0.79-conf-files` directory.

The messaging system now supports self-documenting markup syntax, which is
much easier to read and maintain compared to the previous ANSI escape
sequences.

| Old escape-code style | New markup style |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- |
| `Escribiendo ^[[34;1mdir^[[0m allï¿½ mostrarï¿½ su contenido.` | `Digita [color=blue]dir[reset] per visualizzarne il contenuto.` |


## Notable fixes

- Fixed **Ultima Underworld** issues with gaming (high polling rate) mice
  (#1722)

- Fixed lockups and input issues with the debugger on macOS and Linux. Note
  that for those using the debugger on Linux, we recommend building it with
  SDL 2.0.18, because some input/interaction bugs exist when using newer SDL
  versions.

- Fixed colours becoming very dim on newer Intel integrated GPUs due to
  Intel's OpenGL drivers not properly handling the sRGB linear colour space.

- Fixed a memory-read race condition present during the splash-image display,
  which also reduced start-up time by around 200 ms.

- Fixed display of the low-resolution halfline VESA 2.0 mode used by **Extreme
  Assault** through the addition of a new `vesa_mode` config setting value,
  named `halfline`.

- Named the macOS application "DOSBox Staging.app" per the macOS per Human
  Interface Guidelines.

- Fixed a usability trap door when opening the mapper without mouse support:
  in these cases, the user was unable to exit the mapper. The mapper now only
  opens when mouse support is enabled.
