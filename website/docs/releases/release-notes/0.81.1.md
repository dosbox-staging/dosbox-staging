# 0.81.1 release notes

**Release date:** 2024-04-05

## Summary

The main focus of this maintenance release is to fix a couple of regressions
introduced in 0.81.0, most of them related to game compatibility, and address
a few long-standing issues.

This release was made possible by everyone who tried 0.81.0, submitted bugs and pull requests, and tested the updates. Thank you! :sunglasses:

---

The release fixes the following 0.81.0 regressions:

- Fix **Wing Commander 3** videos and cutscenes appearing height-doubled.

- Fix the Tandy version of **Impossible Mission II** crashing at startup.

- Fix starting **In Extremis** resulting in a black screen.

- Introduce a workaround (`vga_render_per_scanline = off`) to fix the
  crash-at-startup regression in the following Silmarils titles: **Deus**,
  **Ishar 3**, **Robinson's Requiem** and **Time Warriors**.

- Fix the DOSBox Staging window gaining focus on every emulated video mode change.

- Fix crash when exiting DOSBox Staging while in fullscreen mode on macOS and
  Linux.


We've also backported a small number of enhancements and fixes for
long-standing issues:

- Improve support for multiple joysticks/game controllers (the mapper
  could behave erratically if you had more than one controller connected).

- Emulate a memory-expanded PCjr machine more faithfully. This improves game
  compatibilty; for example, **Space Quest** (v1.0x and v2.2) and **King's Quest**
  (1986 PCjr DOS version) now work instead of hanging the emulator.

- CD Audio is no longer muted in certain parts of **Time Warriors** and
  **Alpha Storm**.

- The batch file installer of **Alpha Storm** no longer fails.

- Forcing single scanning via `crt-auto-arcade` should now work
  with more programs.

- Fix various VGA double scanning related edge cases in demoscene
  productions.


Lastly, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translations have been added and most
of the other translations have been updated.

## How to upgrade

Start by downloading the latest version, then make sure to upgrade your
primary configuration as described below.

### Downloads

<div class="compact" markdown>

- [Windows](../windows.md)
- [macOS](../macos.md)
- [Linux](../linux.md)

</div>


### Upgrading your primary configuration

Since config settings might be renamed, altered, or deprecated between
releases, it's best to let DOSBox Staging write the new default primary config
on the first launch, then reapply your old settings manually.

Start by backing up your existing primary config. This is where to find
it on each platform:

<div class="compact" markdown>

| <!-- --> | <!-- -->
|----------|----------
| **Windows**  | `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\DOSBox\dosbox-staging.conf`
| **macOS**    | `~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/dosbox-staging.conf`
| **Linux**    | `~/.config/dosbox/dosbox-staging.conf`

</div>

You can also execute DOSBox Staging with the `--printconf` option to have the
location of the primary config printed to your console.

After backing up the existing primary config, simply start the new version---a
new `dosbox-staging.conf` will be written containing the new defaults and
updated setting descriptions.

!!! note "Portable mode notes"

    In portable mode, `dosbox-staging.conf` resides in the same folder as your
    DOSBox Staging executable. The migration steps for portable mode users are
    as follows:

      - Unpack the new version into a _new_ folder (this is important).
      - Create a new _empty_ `dosbox-staging.conf` file in the new folder to
        enable portable mode.
      - Launch the new version.

    DOSBox Staging will write the new defaults to the empty
    `dosbox-staging.conf` file. After this, you carry over your settings from
    the old primary config manually.

### After upgrading

Look out for deprecation warnings in the logs (in yellow/orange colour) and
update your configs accordingly.


## Graphics-related changes

### VGA double scanning fixes & improvements

- The SVGA/VESA double scanning criteria has been refined which fixes a
  **Wing Commander 3** regression where the videos and cutscenes appeared
  height-doubled.

- Some 320&times;200, 320&times;240 and similar tweaked double-scanned VGA
  modes were incorrectly identified as 320&times;400, 320&times;480, etc.,
  which was confusing in the logs and single scanning could not be forced on
  them (e.g., with `glshader = crt-auto-arcade`). Affected programs include
  **Pinball Dreams**, **Show by Majic 12**, and the **Copper demo** (see the
  [issue ticket](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/3446)
  for the exact details).

- Support "unorthodox" scanline repeats on VGA in forced single scanning mode.
  This improves compatibility with demoscene productions; for example, [Show
  by Majic 12](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1158) sets up a custom
  320&times;64 mode, and then uses scanline-quintupling to repeat every line 5
  times in the zoom-rotator part in the intro.

### Option to revert to legacy VGA rendering

In 0.81.0, we made accurate per-scanline VGA rendering the only rendering
option available (previously, you could only enable this via `machine =
vgaonly`). A minority of games, however, have regressed by this and would
crash at startup.

As a workaround until we improve the accuracy of the VGA emulation, we're
introducing the `vga_render_per_scanline` setting in the `[dosbox]` section.
The setting is enabled by default, but you can disable it to restore the
legacy rendering behaviour on a per game basis.

Disabling `vga_render_per_scanline` fixes the crash-at-startup regression in
the following Silmarils titles:

<div class="compact" markdown>

- **Deus**
- **Ishar 3**
- **Robinson's Requiem**
- **Time Warriors**

</div>

Note that these games are also CPU speed sensitive and would crash with high
cycles settings---see the [issue
ticket](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/3507) for config
recommendations.


### Tandy graphics fixes

Fixed a regression where the Tandy version of **Impossible Mission
II** would crash when starting a new game. This fix should restore our general
compatibility with non-standard Tandy graphics modes as well.


### Other fixes

- Fixed the DOSBox Staging window gaining focus on emulated video mode
  changes.

- Fixed DOSBox Staging crashing when exiting from fullscreen mode on macOS and
  Linux.

## Sound-related changes

### Implement seeking in MSCDEX

A few games use the seek function of the CD-ROM but this was not previusly implemented
in our emulated MSCDEX driver. This resulted in CD Audio playing only sometimes in a few games.

The new seek implementation fixes CD Audio music in at least these titles:

- **Time Warriors** --- CD Audio music is now playing during the main menu and
  gameplay.
- **Alpha Storm** --- CD Audio music is now playing in the opening movie.


??? note "Full PR list of sound-related changes"

    - Implement seeking in MSCDEX (#3516)


## Input-related changes

- Fixed various problems in the mapper when using more than a single game controller
  (e.g., with two joysticks connected, mapping the controls of the first joystick
  could randomly target the mappings of the second one and vice versa).

- Fixed a keyboard handling regression in **In Extremis** where starting the
  game only resulted in a black screen.

- Fixed obscure regression where the `timed = on` joystick setting messed up the
  available free memory reported by the FreeDOS `MEM.EXE` command.

    - Fix handling multiple game controllers (#3404)
    - Fix the 'In Extremis' game intro getting stuck (#3549)
    - Set BIOS_Destroy not changeable at runtime (#3420)


## DOS integration related changes

### Improved expanded PCjr emulation

Now we're emulating a memory-expanded PCjr machine more faithfully. 
This improves game compatibility; for example, **Space Quest** (v1.0x and v2.2) and
**King's Quest** (1986 PCjr DOS version) now work fine---these games
resulted in the emulator hanging previously.

A new `pcjr_memory_config` setting has been introduced to the `[dosbox]`
section, defaulting to `expanded` (the new improved behaviour). Setting this
to `standard` restores the legacy memory model. You should only need this
for a handful of titles, such as the DOS conversions of the **Jumpman** and
**Troll** PC Booter games.


### DOS shell improvements

- Fixed a bug that caused the batch file installer of **Alpha Storm** to fail.

- The help text of the `IMGMOUNT` command now mentions the very handy wildcard
  mounting option. E.g., you can use the `IMGMOUNT A floppy*.img -t floppy`
  command to mount multiple floppy images, then cycle between them with
  ++ctrl+f4++ at runtime (++cmd+f4++ on macOS).

- The `LOADFIX` command's help text is more complete now (some options were
  not documented previously).


??? note "Full PR list of DOS integration related changes"

    - Check the validity of leading path when checking device name (#3525)
    - Improve the IMGMOUNT command's help text (#3551) 
    - Improve the help text of the LOADFIX command (#3221) (#3427)
    - Make PCjr application memory contiguous (#3460)

  runtime is no longer silently accepted (without doing anything) but an
  error is raised instead.
