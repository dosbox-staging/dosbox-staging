This release is significant for several reasons:

1. It's our first stable release. From this point forward, the 0.75.x series
   will only contain bugfixes.

2. It kicks off the 0.76 development cycle, for which a number of features are
   already lined up.

3. The new project homepage makes the downloads publicly accessible, without
   the need for a GitHub account.

There's no human-readable changelog just yet---there are [~1500 commits][diff]
to comb through. Hopefully, within a couple of days, we'll be able to write
a nice summary with a description of new features, improvements, and bugfixes.

In the meantime, we invite everyone to start testing RC1 builds; there are
some rough edges for sure---if you find any bugs, please report them in
[our bugtracker][bugtracker]. You can also ask questions on the
**#dosbox&#8209;staging** channel in [Luxtorpeda Discord Server][discord].

This release includes all upstream changes until SVN r4336, and 857 Git commits
on top of that.

Have fun! :smile:
