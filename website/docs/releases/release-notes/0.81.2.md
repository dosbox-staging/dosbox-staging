# 0.81.2 release notes

**Release date:** 2024-07-21


## Summary

This patch release fixes a critical keyboard regression bug in the classic
Bitmap Brothers game **Gods**. The regression was accidentally introduced in
the **0.81.1** release (#3777).

The game is very difficult to play without this fix, as holding down the
movement keys may result in delayed movement, jerky start/stop motion, or no
movement at all after a bit of playing.
