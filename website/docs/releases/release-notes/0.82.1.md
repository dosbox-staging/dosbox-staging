# 0.82.1 release notes

**Release date:** 2025-??-??

## Summary

The focus of this minor maintenance release is to fix a few regressions introduced
in 0.82.0, and to add a few small enhancements.


### Regression fixes

- Fixed dual-mouse gaming support not working on Windows. This broke 
  the dual-mouse feature in the **The Settlers** and **The Settlers II: Veni,
  Vidi, Vici** on Windows only.

- A new `file_locking` setting has been introduced to allow disabling file
  locking (previously, file locking was always enabled). Setting
  `file_locking = off` fixes the regression of the demo [Astral Blur by The Black
  Lotus](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1) not starting up.
  Please refer to the setting's description to learn more (e.g., run `config
  -h file_locking` from the DOS prompt).

- Fixed a regression where configuration settings were handled in a
  case-sensitive manner across the board (they should be case-insentive; e.g., 
  `cpu_cycles`, `CPU_CYCLES` and `Cpu_CYCles` should refer to the same setting).


### Enhancements and fixes

- Now you can queue setting changes that are unchangeable at runtime. The
  queued setting will be applied on the next emulator restart (via the `config
  -r` command or the restart hotkey). For example, execute the following
  commands to change the machine type to CGA and use 1 MB of RAM:

    ```
    machine cga
    memsize 1
    config -r
    ```

- Config files written with `config -wc PATH` and `-wcd` commands now have a
  blank line inserted after each setting's description to improve readability.

- Fixed a bug where certain `startup_verbosity` settings could lead to a blank
  console.
