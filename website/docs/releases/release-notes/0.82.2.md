# 0.82.2 release notes

**Release date:** 2025-06-17


## Summary

This maintenance release corrects the minimum required macOS version
regression introduced in 0.82.1 plus adds a few minor enhancements and fixes:

- The minimum supported macOS version was raised to **macOS 14 (Sonoma)** in 0.82.1 by
  mistake. This is now fixed; DOSBox Staging 0.82.2 requires **macOS 11 (Big
  Sur)** or later.

- Fix incorrect handling of read-only directories on Linux and macOS. This
  fixes **DeuTex** (DOOM WAD extractor).

- Fix emulator hanging when quitting DOSBox Staging while rebooting is in
  progress.

- Restarting DOSBox with `CONFIG -R` or the restart hotkey now correctly saves
  the command line history.

- Allow read-only directories to be deleted with the `RMDIR` DOS command on
  Windows.

- Update bundled FreeDOS **XCOPY** to v1.9a.


This release was made possible by everyone who tried 0.82.1, submitted bugs
and pull requests, and tested the updates. Thank you!
