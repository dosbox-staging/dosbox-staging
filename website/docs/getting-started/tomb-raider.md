# Tomb Raider

[Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider) is an
action-adventure where the said adventure mainly revolves around stealing
ancient artifacts from the indigineous population of various exotic locations,
and contributing to the mass extinction of the native wildlife. Yeah, games in
the 90s were weird like that... Just think of it as self-defence and you'll be
fine. The tomb-raiding aspect was really a continuation of Core Design's truly
excellent arcade-platformer, [Rick
Dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Dangerous), which was in turn
loosely based on the stories of the archetypal raider of tombs, Indiana Jones.
It's a fun and very atmospheric game---just don't take anything in it too
seriously.

Released in the late DOS-era in 1996, it's a rather performance intensive game
featuring advanced software-rendered 3D graphics with 640&times;480 resolution
support. It's the perfect entry to conclude our guide with.
