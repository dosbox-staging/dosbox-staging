# Setting up Prince of Persia

## First steps

We will set up the demo version of [Prince of Persia](), the classic
cinematic platformer from 1990 as our first example. It was a landmark game,
and it can still provide you with countless hours of entertainment if you like
platformers that require you to exercise that pesky gray matter a bit too.

First of all, we'll create a new folder for storing all our DOS games. I'll
use `DOS Games` throughout this guide, but you can pick any name you like.
It's best to create this folder in your regular documents folder so DOSBox has
full read and write access to it (don't put it in a system folder, e.g.,
`Program Files` on Windows). Each individual game will have its own dedicated
subfolder under `DOS Games`, so let's create our first one called `Prince of
Persia`.

Now download [pop1.zip](pop1.zip) and extract its contents
into `DOS Games/Prince of Persia`. The archive contained only two files:
`pop1.txt` (a regular text file) and `pop1demo.exe` (an MS-DOS executable).
Let's open the text file in our text editor!

    It's like an Arabian Nights movie come to life... with you as the star!
    Leap into an exotic labyrinth of heart-stopping action, challenging mazes,
    intrigue and superb animation that's breathtakingly realistic!

    This is a demonstration version which only has limited functionality.  To
    obtain the full program, just access GO BB, and order it from our store.

I'm not quite sold on the "heart-stopping" part, but otherwise sounds
intriguing! As indicated by the second paragraph, this is a fully playable
demo version that includes only the first two levels of the game. That's more
than enough for our purposes here, and you can always get the full game later.

But there are no further instructions, so what should we do next? Well,
setting up old DOS games is not all that dissimilar to solving adventure game
puzzles. Getting past these puzzles require some logical thinking, a little
bit of background knowledge, and an element of trial and error is occasionally
involved as well. Well, the user manual often helps too if you happen to own
the original, or are able to procure a [scanned copy][pop-manual] online (most
often you can).

[pop-manual]: https://ia600809.us.archive.org/29/items/princeofpersia_201708_201708/prince-of-persia_dos_04ra.pdf

Luckily, this is an easy one: MS-DOS executables have the `exe` or `com` file
extension, so looking at `pop1demo.exe` the solution is quite obvious: we'll
need to run this executable file in DOSBox!


## The C drive

Most DOS games need a hard drive as a *hard requirement* (okay, I'll show
myself to the door...), but DOSBox doesn't have access to your computer's hard
drive by default where your programs and documents reside---we need to tell it
which folder to use as its "virtual DOS hard drive". This is called
*mounting*; we *mount* a folder as the "DOS hard drive", the contents of which
is then available to DOSBox as the **C drive**. All drives in DOS are assigned
to the letters of the English alphabet (just like in Windows), and the C drive
is usually your first hard drive.

The recommended way to mount the C drive is to create a `drives` subfolder
inside your game folder. This `drives` folder is a "magic" folder with a
special purpose: all its subfolders having single-letter names are
automatically mounted as DOS drives with the same letter. In our case, we only
need a single C drive, so we'll create a `c` subfolder inside our `drives`
folder (technically, it does not make a difference if you use uppercase or
lowercase `C` on Windows and macOS; Linux people should use lowercase `c`).
We'll then copy the files from the `pop1.zip` archive into `drives/c` to end
up with the following folder structure:

![](images/pop-tree1.png){ .skip-lightbox style="width: 14.5rem; margin: 0.9rem calc(50% - 8.5rem);" }


!!! note "Origins of the C drive"

    Have you ever wondered where the "C drive" in Windows got its name from?
    This is something Windows inherited from its MS-DOS heritage. In DOS, all
    drives are assigned letters from A to Z. Most computers of the era had two
    floppy drives, so letters A and B were reserved for them or other
    removable media, and the first hard drive partition was usually assigned
    to the letter C. We no longer have floppy drives in our computers as
    standard equipment, but this tradition stuck around for
    backwards-compatibility reasons.


!!! important

    If you're a Windows user, do not confuse your *real* C drive where your
    operating system and programs are stored with the "virtual DOS C drive" of
    DOSBox. It is important to understand the distinction between these two as
    they are completely separate concepts---DOSBox will *not* see the contents
    of your real C drive by default (or the contents of any of your other
    drives, for the matter).


## Starting DOSBox

Okay, with our C drive set up and ready to go, the next step is to start
DOSBox from our `DOS Games/Prince of Persia` folder. This is accomplished
slightly differently on each platform:

**Windows**

If you have used the installer with the default options to set up DOSBox (and
it's highly recommended to do so while you're still learning the ropes),
simply right-click on the `Prince of Persia` folder in Windows Explorer and
select the *Start DOSBox from this folder* in the context menu.

**macOS**

1. Mount the DOSBox installer `.dmg` image file.
1. Copy the *Start DOSBox Staging* icon from the appearing window into the `Prince of Persia` folder.
1. Right-click or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-click the icon, then select the topmost
   *Open* menu item.
1. A dialog with the following text will appear: **macOS cannot verify the
   developer of "Start DOSBox Staging". Are you sure you want to open it?**
1. Press the *Open* button.

You only need to perform this procedure once when opening the *Start DOSBox
Staging* icon for the first time. After the first launch, you can use it like
any other regular icon.

!!! tip

    To avoid having to repeat these steps every time when yuo set up a new
    game, copy an icon on which you have performed this initial procedure
    already, rather than keep copying the original one from the `.dmg` file.

**Linux**

`cd` into the `Prince of Persia` folder and run the `dosbox` command.


## Installing the game

You'll be greeted by the following window when starting DOSBox:

<figure markdown>
  ![](images/start.png)
</figure>

Let's ignore the polite welcome message for now and focus on the text below
the blue banner.

<pre class="dos-prompt">
Local directory drives/c/ mounted as C drive
Z:\>_
</pre>

The first line is pretty straighforward---it tells us that DOSBox mounted
`drives/C` we created earlier as the C drive.

The second line is the DOS prompt. DOS has a command line interface which
predates graphical user interfaces we're accustomed to from modern operating
systems. We get DOS to do things by typing in commands, and if manage to do
this correctly, DOS will follow our instructions to the letter (pun intended!)
DOS is *not* a multitasking operating system; you can only do a single
thing in it at any given point in time.

Let's analyse the prompt a little bit. It always stars with a letter followed
by a semicolon which denotes the current drive. Right after startup, this is
always the `Z` drive. This is a special drive that's always available; DOSBox
stores some of its commands on itâ€”you don't need to worry about it now.

After the semicolon is the path of the current folder, or current *directory*
in DOS terminology. This is currently the root-directory of the `Z` drive as
indicated by the `\` (backslash) character. The `>` character just signifies
the end of the promp, and the blinking underscore (`_`) character after it
is---guess what?---the cursor.

Okay, enough theory, type in `C:` and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to switch
to the C drive. The prompt should now reflect that we're in the root-directory
of the C drive:

<pre class="dos-prompt">
Z:\>c:
C:\>_
</pre>

Type in `dir` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to list the contents of the current
directory:

<pre class="dos-prompt">
C:\>dir
 Volume in drive C is CDRIVE
 Directory of C:\

POP1     TXT                     362 07/07/1995 10:12a
POP1DEMO EXE                 267,420 07/05/1995  9:53a
                4 file(s)               268,116 bytes
                0 dir(s)            262,144,000 bytes free
C:\>_
</pre>

Well, that's what we put into our virtual C drive, so nothing too spectacular
so far. We'll execute `pop1demo.exe` next! Type in `pop` and press the
<kbd>Tab</kbd> once once to instruct DOSBox to complete the filename for you.
This handy feature is called *tab-completion* and it saves you from a lot of
typing! Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> a few more times and observe how it alternates
between `POP1.TXT` and `POP1DEMO.EXE`; this makes sense as these are the only
two files in the current directory that start with `pop`.

Okay, let's make sure `POP1DEMO.EXE` is displayed in the prompt then press
<kbd>Enter</kbd> to run this executable file. It turns out this is a
self-extracting archive that unpacks its contents into the current directory
when you run it. The following will appear (I've redacted the list of
extracted files):

<pre class="dos-prompt">
C:\>POP1DEMO.EXE

PKSFX (R)   FAST!   Self Extract Utility   Version 2.04g  02-01-93
Copr. 1989-1993 PKWARE Inc. All Rights Reserved. Shareware version

Searching EXE: C:/POP1DEMO.EXE
  Inflating: CDUNGEON.DAT
  Inflating: DIGISND1.DAT

  ...

  Inflating: PRINCE.EXE

C:\>_
</pre>

The more observant among you might have noticed the last entry, `PRINCE.EXE`.
Bingo, that's our game executable! But let's pretend we haven't spotted it;
how do we find all executables in the current directory? By issuing the `dir`
command with the `*.exe` wildcard search pattern!

<pre class="dos-prompt">
C:\>dir *.exe
 Volume in drive C is CDRIVE
 Directory of C:\

POP1DEMO EXE                 267,420 07/05/1995  9:53a

                0 dir(s)            262,144,000 bytes free
C:\>_
</pre>


## Starting the game

There's nothing else left to do than to start `PRINCE.EXE` (type in
`PRINCE.EXE` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>). After a short loading time, the
title screen will appear and you'll hear the classic Prince of Persia intro
music playing! Don't press any key yet, just wait and watch the intro sequence
until the end to learn about the game's backstory.

If you keep watching, the game will enter demo mode, where the protagonist
will soon meet his untimely death... Surely we can do better than that! Press
any key to start the game!

You control the prince with the cursor keys, and you can walk carefully by
holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key. It's not that hard to figure out the various
movement combinations on your own, but reading the **Controlling Your
Movements** section of the [user
manual](https://ia600809.us.archive.org/29/items/princeofpersia_201708_201708/prince-of-persia_dos_04ra.pdf)
should definitely help. The manual also contains helpful hints and the list
of other keyboard shortcuts you can use during the game.

Congratulations, you've got your very first DOS game running in DOSBox! Have
some fun, try to find the sword and overcome a few guards, maybe even attempt
to fully complete the first level.

You can quit the game by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> which will
return you to the DOS prompt. There you can use the `exit` command to close
DOSBox. Of course, you can quit DOSBox any time by pressing
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or
<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> on macOS.

!!! note

    The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> shortcut for quitting the game is
    specific to Prince of Persia. Other games might provide completely
    different mechanisms for exiting to DOS, or perhaps none at all.


!!! tip "How to approach old games"

    If you've only ever played modern games, you're probably in for a bit of a
    culture shock! There's minimal to no handholding in most DOS games from
    the 1980s and the 90s, you are expected to read the user manual, often
    there is no in-game tutorial, and the games are generally unforgiving and
    require a level of dedication from the player that's uncommon in more
    modern titles.

    However, this does not mean that these game are less fun, on the contrary!
    The old adage "you get what you put in" is certainly true for old DOS
    games. Many people (including the author of this present article) think
    that the satisfaction and enjoyment you get when mastering such difficult
    games has few parallels in the modern gaming landscape.


## Auto-executing commands at startup

Every time we want to play the game, we need to type in DOS commands to switch
to the `C` drive and run `prince.exe` from there. Isn't there a way to
automate this?

There certainly is! We need to create a so called
*configuration file* that can contain various parameters to customise the
behaviour of DOSBox, along with a list of commands to auto-execute at startup.

Launch your text editor of choice and create a new plain text file called
`dosbox.conf` inside the `Prince of Persia` folder with the following content:

```ini
[autoexec]
c:
prince
```

The commands you want to be executed right after startup should be listed in
the aptly titled `[autoexec]` configuration section, each command in a
separate line. Configuration sections are introduced by names enclosed in square
brackets; everything that follows belongs to that section.

!!! warning

    Some text editors insist on using appending the `.txt` extension after the
    filename you enter in their save dialog. This might result in creating a
    file called `dosbox.conf.txt` which won't work. Get to know your text
    editor and make sure you save the configuration file as `dosbox.conf`.

When DOSBox starts, it looks for this special `dosbox.conf` file in the folder
it was started from, and if it finds it, it configures the DOS environment and
DOSBox itself according to its contents. This is handy because we can put a
different configuration file into each of our game folders to set them up
differently.

Just to make everything absolutely clear, this is the folder structure we
should have at this point:

![](images/pop-tree2.png){ .skip-lightbox style="width: 14.5rem; margin: 0.9rem calc(50% - 8.5rem);" }

Starting up DOSBox from the `Prince of Persia` folder should now launch the
game right away without any manual intervention!
