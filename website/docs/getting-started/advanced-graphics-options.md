## Aspect ratios, square pixels & black borders

Okay, let's tackle the pressing question every second person wants an answer
for: why doesn't the image fill the screen completely? And why are there black
borders around it? (Well, that's two questions, but nevermind.)

Computer monitors were originally *not* widescreen but had a 4:3 display
aspect ratio, just like old television sets. The complete switch to 16:9 in
computer monitors and laptops happened only by the early 2010s. The
low-resolution 320&times;200 VGA mode was designed to completely fill a 4:3
CRT screen. When displaying such 4:3 aspect ratio content on a 16:9 modern
flat panel, it's inevitable to get black bars on the sides of the image (this
is called _pillarboxing_).

Hang on a second, something is not right here... 320:200 can be simplified to
16:10, which is quite close to 16:9, which means 320&times;200 resolution
content _should_ fill a 16:9 screen almost completely with only very minor
pillarboxing! Sure, that would be true if the pixels of the 320&times;200 VGA
mode were perfect little squares, but they are not. How so?

As mentioned, 320&times;200 graphics completely fills the screen on a 4:3
aspect ratio CRTâ€”that's only possible if the pixels are not perfect squares,
but slightly tall rectangles. With square pixels, you'd get some
_letterboxing_ below the image (the horizontal version of pillarboxing) as
shown on the below image. If you do the maths, it turns out the pixels need to
be exactly 20% taller than wide.

<figure markdown>

  is some letterboxing below the image; Right: the same image with 20% taller
  pixels on the same monitor---the image fills the screen completely
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Here's how to derive it: 4:3 can be rewritten as 320:240 if you multiply both
the numerator and denominator by 80. Then 240 divided by 200 is 1.2, so the _pixel
aspect ratio_, or PAR---the mathematical ratio that describes how the width of a
pixel compares to its height---is **1:1.2**, which can be rewritten as
**5:6**.

But hey, not everybody likes maths, especially not in the middle of a gaming
session! Most of the time, you won't need to worry about aspect ratio
correctness because DOSBox Staging handles that automatically for you
out-of-the-box. There is a small but significant number of games where
overriding aspect ratio correction and forcing square pixels yields better
results.


!!! note "When pixels are not squares"

    Sadly, this very important fact of computing history that monitors were
    *not* widescreen until about 2010 tends to be forgotten nowadays. Older
    DOSBox versions did not perform aspect ratio correction by default which
    certainly did not help matters either. The unfortunate situation is that
    you're much more likely to encounter videos and screenshots of DOS games
    in the wrong aspect ratio (using square pixels) on the Internet today.
    Well, that's only true for more recently created content---if you check
    out any old computer magazine from the 1980s and the 90s, most screenshots
    are shown in the correct aspect ratio (but rarely the magazines got it
    wrong too...)

    In case you're wondering, pixels are completely square in 640&times;480
    and higher resolutions (1:1 pixel aspect ratio), but there exist a few
    more weird video modes with non-square pixels, e.g., the 640&times;350 EGA
    mode with 1:1.3714 PAR, the 640&times;200 EGA mode (1:2.4 PAR), and the
    720&times;348 Hercules graphics mode (1:1.5517 PAR).


## Integer scaling 

That explains the black bars on the sides, but what about the letterboxing I
sometimes see above and below the image? Why doesn't the graphics fill the
screen vertically and why does it change size, depending on the DOS video
mode? 

Again, we need a little history lesson to understand what's going on. CRT
monitors did not have a fixed pixel-grid like modern flat panels; they were a
lot more flexible and could display *any* resolution within the physical
limits of the monitor. In fact, they did not even have discrete "pixels" in
the sense as modern flat panels do---the image was literally projected onto
the screen, similarly to how movie a projector works.

Modern flat screens, however, do have a fixed native resolution, and the
scanlines of the emulated CRT image need to "line up" with this fixed pixel
grid vertically, otherwise we might get quite unpleasant looking interference
artifacts (these usually manifest as wavy vertical patterns). When DOSBox
Staging enlarges the emulated image to fill the screen, by default it
constrains the vertical scaling factor to integer values; this ensures perfect
alignment with the native pixel grid of the display. The horizontal direction
is rarely a problem, so non-integer horizontal scaling factors are generally
fine. 

Assuming a 4K monitor with 3840&times;2160 native resolution, the
320&times;200 VGA mode double-scanned to 640&times;400 will be enlarged by a
factor of 5 vertically, and by a 5 &times; 4/3 = 6.6667 factor horizontally to
maintain the correct 4:3 aspect ratio of the upscaled image. The final
output will be 2667&times;2000, so those 160 unused pixels in the
vertical direction account for the slight letterboxing above and below the
image.

Now, the higher your monitor resolution, the more you can get away with using
non-integer vertical scaling ratios. It's just that enabling vertical integer
scaling by default is the only surefire way to completely avoid ugly
interefence artifacts on everybody's monitors out-of-the-box. If you play
games in fullscreen on a 4K screen, you can safely disable integer scaling
without any adverse effects up to the 640&times;480 VGA resolution. Just put
the following into your config:

```ini
[render]
integer_scaling = off
```

If you don't have a 4K or monitor or you like to play your games in windowed
mode, you'll need to experiment a bit---some monitor resolution, window size,
and DOS video mode combinations look fine without integer scaling, some will
result in interference patterns.


## Sharp pixels

Okay, enough blabbering about all those near-extinct, mythical  cathode-ray tube
contraptions, grandpa. Can you just give us sharp pixels and be done with it?

Sure thing, kiddo. Just put this into your config:

```ini
[render]
glshader = sharp
```

By default, integer scaling is disabled when the `sharp` shader is selected,
so if you want to re-enable it, you'll need to add another line:

```ini
[render]
glshader = sharp
integer_scaling = vertical
```

This will yield 100% sharp pixels vertically, no matter what. Horizontally,
there might be a 1-pixel-wide interpolation band at the sides of _some_
pixels, depending on the DOS video mode and the upscale factor. This is the
best possible compromise between maintaining the correct aspect ratio, even
horizontal pixel widths, and good overall sharpness.

The resulting image has quite acceptable horizontal sharpness at 1080p, and
from 1440p upwards, you'll be hard pressed to notice the occasional 1-pixel
interpolation band... unless you're inspecting the image with your nose
pressed against the monitor (well, how about not doing that then? :thinking:)


## Custom viewport resolution

That's very nice and all, but now the graphics looks as if it was constructed
from brightly coloured little bricks at fullscreen on a 24" or larger modern
display!

Well, 14" VGA monitors were still the most affordable and thus most popular
option until the mid-1990s, close to the end of the DOS era. Before that, CGA
and EGA monitors were typically 12" or 14", and monochrome Hercules monitors
only 10" or 12". And these are just the "nominal" diagonal screen sizes---the
actual visible area was about 1.5 to 2 inches smaller!

To emulate the physical image size you'd get on a typical 14" VGA monitor,
you'd need to restrict the output to about 960&times;720 on a modern 24"
widescreen display with 16:9 aspect ratio (assuming the same normal viewing
distance). Basically, you want the resulting image to measure about 12 inches (30
cm) diagonally for the most authentic results. But alas, that would be a tad too
small for most people. 960&times;720 would result in a non-integer vertical
scale factor, anyway, which to be avoided. It's best to bump it
up to 1067&times;800 then:


```ini
[render]
viewport = 1067x800
```

The viewport size is specified in _logical units_ (more on that below). You
can also specify the viewport restriction as a percentage of the size of your
desktop:

```ini
[render]
viewport = 80%
```

The video output will be sized to fit within the bounds of this rectangle
while keeping the correct aspect ratio. If integer scaling is also enabled,
the resulting image might be become smaller than the specified viewport size.


!!! note "No, DOS games did not look like Roman mosaics..."

    Running DOS games in fullscreen on a modern 24" widescreen display is
    equivalent to playing them on a 21" CRT monitor! Those huge beasts were
    used by (and most importantly, _priced for_) professionals, so extremely
    few gamers and enthusiasts saw low-resolution art blown up to look like
    Roman mosaics back in the day. Even _yours truly_ performed all the tricks
    in the book to shrink 320&times;200 DOS games as much as possible on his
    19" CRT in the early 2000s...


!!! info "Logical units vs pixels"

    Most operating systems operate in high DPI mode using a 200% scaling
    factor on 4K displays and use "unscaled" _logical units_ for specifying
    window dimensions. The `viewport` setting adopts the same approach; the
    viewport size must be always specified in logical units.

    For example, on a 4K display, a viewport resolution specified as
    `1280x960` logical units will translate to 2560&times;1920 *physical
    pixels* (assuming a typical 200% scaling factor). Then on 1080p with a
    100% scaling factor, it will simply translate to 1280&times;960 pixels.


!!! danger "Maths time!"

    This is hardcore mode---only for the brave and the mathematically-inclined
    shall prevail!

    - Assuming a 1920&times;1080 desktop resolution, `viewport = 80%` will restrict
      the maximum viewport size to 1536&times;864 _logical units_.
    - The viewport size is a _potential_. With integer scaling _disabled_ and aspect ratio
      correction _enabled_, for a 4:3 aspect ratio DOS image you'd get a
      1152&times;864 image in _logical units_ (because 1152 / 864 = 4/3).
    - This would result in  1152&times;864 _pixels_ on 1080p monitors, then on 4K
      monitors with 200% DPI scaling, the resulting image would be 2304&times;1728
      _pixels_.
    - With integer scaling _enabled_ and assuming a 320&times;200 input image,
      864 / 200 = 4.32, so a 4x vertical integer scaling factor will be used.
      The resulting image will be 1067&times;800 on 1080p and 2133&times;1600
      on 4K.


## Custom aspect ratios

Psssst... Don't tell anyone, but DOSBox Staging features a hidden "screw the
developer's intent" switch as well (also known as "LOL what aspect ratio?"
mode). To unleash its formidable powers, put this casually into your config
when no one's looking:

```ini
[render]
aspect = stretch
```

DOSBox Staging will now happily trample over any authentic aspect ratios and
stretch the image to the full extents of the viewport. Keep resizing the
window and see what happens. Whoopee! Now you can play Prince of Persia
completely stretched to a widescreen monitor like a barbarian!

Jokes aside, this mode might come in handy when playing text adventures in
fullscreen; it's hard to argue the correct aspect ratio matters much for those
games. The same reasoning can also be applied to more abstract graphical
games (although opinions on that are somewhat divisive...)

You can also specify custom aspect ratios in the form of horizontal and
vertical "stretch factors". This emulates the horizontal and vertical stretch
controls of CRT monitors. For example, we can correct the [squashed
look](enhancing-prince-of-persia.md#hercules) of the Hercules graphics in Prince of Persia with the
following magic incantations:

```ini
[render]
aspect = stretch
viewport = relative 112% 173%
```
