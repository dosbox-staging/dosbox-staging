# Star Wars: Dark Forces

We will continue our trend of featuring a disproportionate amount of LucasArts
games in our guide---which I'm fine with, and they were one of the best and
most prestigious game development studios from the DOS era. The game we'll
tackle next is [Star Wars: Dark
Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Dark_Forces) from 1995, an
example of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre, featuring fast
software-rendered 3D graphics.

The game attempts to enhance the basic DOOM formula by adding a storyline,
cutscenes, missions with specific objectives, light puzzles, and even some
stealth elements. Of course, there's shooting too. Lots of shooting.
