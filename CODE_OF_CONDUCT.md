# Code of Conduct

In order to foster a welcoming, positive, and rewarding experience, we as
community members pledge to uphold this code of conduct.

*Isn't decent behavior is already expected?* We want to bring our best to each
other as peers, and explicitly documenting our expectations lets us set a high
bar for ourselves.

## Be excellent to each other

"Excellent" means we:

- **are wholly inclusive** to existing members and newcomers looking to
  learn or participate. Some may raise questions that have been addressed
  before. Kindly point them to existing discussions. Everyone was new to a
  project once.
- **respect** your abilities, interests, and personal differences.  Our
  different talents documenting, testing, coding, reviewing, reporting, and/or
  evangelizing are all valuable to the project.
- **make concise and actionable points** to respect your time as a volunteer.
  We respect each other's time by keeping the signal-to-noise ratio high,
  staying on-topic, and being a good house-guest: every visit we strive to
  leave the place in better shape than when we arrived.
- **are kind** and **assume positive intent**, even when we disagree while
  working towards consensus and achieving the project's technical goals.
- **educate and illuminate** others with something we know more about. We were
  all beginners once, and can teach and learn through feedback and sharing.
- **are open to feedback** from others, be it technical points, interpersonal
  tips, or language/wording suggestions.
- **accept responsibility** by apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
  and graciously accepting apologies knowing that mistakes are part of the
  process.
- **use words carefully**, because we may not understand irony or negative
  sarcasm. We communicate plainly, and we justify our positions objectively and
  explicitly.
- **leave with class**, without drama or bitterness, when resigning for any
  reason. We champion your rights under the terms of the GPL to fork the code
  and create a new project, just as we stand on the shoulders of those who gave
  us the right to create this project.
