# Code of Conduct

In order to foster a welcoming, positive, and rewarding experience, we as
community members pledge to uphold this code of conduct.

*Isn't decent behavior already expected?* We want to bring our best to each
other as peers, and explicitly documenting our expectations lets us set a high
bar for ourselves.

## Be excellent to each other

"Excellent" means we:

- **are wholly inclusive** to existing members and newcomers looking to
  learn or participate. Some may raise questions that have been addressed
  before. Kindly point them to existing discussions. Everyone was new to a
  project once.
- **respect** your abilities, interests, and personal differences.  Our
  different talents documenting, testing, coding, reviewing, reporting, and/or
  evangelizing are all valuable to the project.
- **make concise and actionable points** to respect your time as a volunteer.
  We respect each other's time by keeping the signal-to-noise ratio high,
  staying on-topic, and being a good house-guest: every visit we strive to
  leave the place in better shape than when we arrived.
- **are kind** and **assume positive intent**, even when we disagree while
  working towards consensus and achieving the project's technical goals.
- **educate and illuminate** others with something we know more about. We were
  all beginners once, and can teach and learn through feedback and sharing.
- **are open to feedback** from others, be it technical points, interpersonal
  tips, or language/wording suggestions.
- **accept responsibility** by apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
  and graciously accept apologies knowing that mistakes are part of the
  process.
- **use words carefully**, because we may not understand irony or negative
  sarcasm. We communicate plainly, and we justify our positions objectively and
  explicitly.
- **leave with class**, without drama or bitterness, when resigning for any
  reason. We champion your rights under the terms of the GPL to fork the code
  and create a new project, just as we stand on the shoulders of those who gave
  us the right to create this project.

## Reporting Issues

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team (see below). All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated
to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
