DOSBox Staging License
----------------------

The DOSBox Staging project is a fork of the DOSBox project, and as
such, all works derived from the DOSBox project carry the same
license terms as granted by the DOSBox authors, which is the "GNU
General Public License version 2 or later" (GPL-2.0-or-later).

Original works authored by the DOSBox Staging team are also
licensed under the GPL-2.0-or-later terms to maximize portability
of code with both upstream and other DOSBox forks.

Most third party libraries used by Staging are licensed under the
GPL-2.0-or-later terms, however there are some exceptions:

- MAME's Philips SAA1099 and Texas Instruments SN76489 emulators,
  under the src/hardware/mame directory, are both licensed under
  the BSD 3-Clause terms.

- MandrakeSoft's National Semiconductor NE2000 emulator, in file
  src/hardware/ne2000.cpp, which is licensed under the
  LGPL-2.1-or-later terms.

- Timothy Lottes' has dedicated his CRT-styled scan-line GLSL
  shader, in file contrib/resources/glshaders/crt/fakelottes-flat.glsl,
  to the public domain.

- Libraries in src/libs directory, are licensed as follows:
   - decoders/archive.h, stb.h, and stb_vorbis.h: Public Domain
   - decoders/dr_flac.h, dr_mp3.h, and dr_wav.h: Public Domain or MIT
   - decoders/xxhash.h: BSD 2-Clause
   - enet: MIT
   - ghc: MIT
   - iir1: MIT
   - loguru: Public Domain
   - ManyMouse: Zlib
   - PDcurses: Public Domain
   - simde: MIT
   - stb_truetype: MIT or Public Domain
   - whereami: MIT or WTFPL
   - YM7128B_emu: BSD 2-Clause

The above licenses meet GNU's qualifications for being free
software (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html) and
are compatible with the GNU GPL.
