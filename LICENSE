DOSBox Staging License
----------------------

The DOSBox Staging project is a fork of the DOSBox project, and as
such, all works derived from the DOSBox project carry the same
license terms as granted by the DOSBox authors, which is the "GNU
General Public License version 2 or later" (GPL-2.0-or-later).

Original works authored by the DOSBox Staging team are also
licensed under the GPL-2.0-or-later terms to maximize portability
of code with both upstream and other DOSBox forks.

Most third party libraries used by Staging are licensed under the
GPL-2.0-or-later terms, however there are some exceptions:

- MAME's Philips SAA1099 and Texas Instruments SN76489 emulators,
  under the src/hardware/mame directory, are both licensed under
  the BSD 3-Clause terms.

- MandrakeSoft's National Semiconductor NE2000 emulator, in file
  src/hardware/ne2000.cpp, which is licensed under the
  LGPL-2.1-or-later terms.

- Timothy Lottes' has dedicated his CRT-styled scan-line GLSL
  shader, in file contrib/resources/glshaders/crt-fakelottes-flat.glsl,
  to the public domain.

- Libraries in src/libs directory, are licensed as follows:
   - decoders/archive.h, stb.h, and stb_vorbis.h: Public Domain
   - decoders/dr_flac.h, dr_mp3.h, and dr_wav.h: Public Domain or MIT
   - decoders/xxhash.h: BSD 2-Clause
   - enet: MIT
   - ghc: MIT
   - gui_tk: GPL-3.0-or-later
   - iir1: MIT
   - loguru: Public Domain
   - PDcurses: Public Domain
   - whereami: MIT or WTFPL
   - YM7128B_emu: BSD 2-Clause

The above licenses meet GNU's qualifications for being free
software (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html) and
are compatible with the GNU GPL.


Individual Source File Licenses 
-------------------------------

The license of each individual DOSBox Staging source file can be
found in the first few lines after "SPDX-License-Identifier". The
full text for each license can be found in the licenses/
directory.

Some libraries have their own COPYING or LICENSE file in their
respective subdirectories, however, when not available, the license
is described in the source files themselves.

See also https://spdx.org/licenses/ for the full license texts,
and https://spdx.org/ids for the standardized header format.
